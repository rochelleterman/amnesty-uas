 USA (Texas): Death penalty / Legal concern: Angel Maturino Res√©ndiz (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Mexican national Angel Maturino Resândiz, aged 46, is scheduled for execution on 27 June 2006. He was sentenced to death for the 1998 murder of Claudia Benton, a doctor in Houston. He is also believed to have committed a series of murders in several other US states. There is evidence that Angel Maturino Resândiz suffers from serious mental illness, including paranoid schizophrenia. His lawyers are arguing that he is incompetent for execution and that his execution would therefore violate the US Constitution.
