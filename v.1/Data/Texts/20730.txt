 NA 
 In his sentencing hearing on 13 September 1999,           16-year-old Colin Gonzales was sentenced to 19 years in   prison for a murder he committed when he was 14 years     old. His lawyers immediately filed a ""motion for          reconsideration"", asking the judge to reconsider his      original decision to treat Colin as an adult rather than  a juvenile.
