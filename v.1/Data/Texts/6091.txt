 The mayor of a town in southern Guatemala, FlorentÁn Gudiel, was murdered on 20 December 2004. He had been campaigning against corruption and also for justice for his son, who ""disappeared"" in 1983, while the country was under military rule. Since he was killed his family have received numerous death threats, and Amnesty International believes they are in grave danger, particularly his daughter Makrina Gudiel µlvarez, a local councillor who had also been fighting corruption.
