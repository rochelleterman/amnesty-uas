 EXTRA 82/93 - Indonesia: legal concern / possible prisoner of conscience: Dedi Ekadibrata | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Dedi Ekadibrata is in imminent danger of arrest because of his non-violent activities on behalf of farming communities in the Bogor area of West Java. A warrant for his arrest was issued a few days after he took part in a peaceful demonstration over land issues in Jakarta on 24 September 1993. Together with at least 17 others he was detained for questioning at the time but was released without charge some hours later. About 300 other peaceful protesters, including women and children, were also detained by military authorities. Most were held for 13 hours before being released without charge. There are reportedly ten others, including farmers, students and human rights activists who remain in detention. It is uncertain if they have been or will be formally charged. "
