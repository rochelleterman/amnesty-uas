 The lawyers of parliamentarian, Mamun al-Humsi, a         prisoner of conscience on trial and charged with          offences, including ""attempting to change the             constitution by illegal means"", have urged that his       hearing be deferred due to his poor health condition; and the fact that he is being denied access to specialist     medical care as requested by a doctor who saw him at Adra prison where he is being held."
