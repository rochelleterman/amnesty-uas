 United Kingdom: Further information: Forcible return from UK to Somalia deferred | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 23 June, the UK authorities deferred their plans to forcibly return “Mr S”, a rejected Somali asylum-seeker to Mogadishu, the capital city of Somalia. He has been released from immigration detention. The UK authorities, however, maintain their policy that rejected asylum-seekers forcibly returned to southern and central Somalia are not at risk."
