 Lithuania:  Possible adoption of homophobic legislation | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 16 June 2009, the Lithuanian parliament (The Seimas) passed a law which includes an amendment which institutionalizes homophobia, violates the right to freedom of expression and the right to be free from discrimination. The President has ten days to decide whether or not to veto the law. Should he decide to sign the “Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effect of Public information”, an alarming national legal precedent will be set."
