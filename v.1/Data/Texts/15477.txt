 United Kingdom: Forcible return/Fear of Torture: Jamil el-Banna (m) 

 | Amnesty International 
 Jamil el-Banna, a Jordanian national who was recognized as a refugee by the UK in 1997, has been cleared for release from Guantænamo Bay, and intends to return to the UK, where his wife and five children live. He holds a current and valid refugee travel document, and should be entitled to return. The UK authorities have until 9 August to decide whether to allow him to return: if they do not, it is feared that he could instead be forcibly returned to Jordan, where he would face a real risk of torture.
