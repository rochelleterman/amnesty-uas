 Zimbabwe: Fear of more mass evictions in Harare | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Thousands of people in Harare face mass eviction from their market stalls and homes.  Most of the targeted people were victims of the 2005 mass forced evictions that left about 700,000 people without homes or livelihood or both.  Four years on, the authorities now want to forcibly re-evict some of these people."
