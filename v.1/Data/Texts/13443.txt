 Sri Lanka: death threats / fear of torture: Tharmalingam Selvakumar and others | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of Tharmalingam Selvakumar who has received death threats since he filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka alleging violation of his fundamental human rights to freedom from torture and arbitrary detention. A former sympathiser of the Eelam People's Democratic Party (EPDP), a militant Tamil group allied with the government, he has come under pressure from the EPDP, who have threatened to kill him, and the police who have apparently threatened to bring false charges against him, linking him with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTEE)."
