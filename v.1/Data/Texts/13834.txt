 Albania: Possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Sulejman Rrahman Mekollari, Dilaver Ibrahim Dauti, Lirim Servet Veliu and Gani Korri (possibly Kolla) are currently on trial before the district court of Saranda. They appear to have been charged under Article 225 of the Criminal Code with ""distributing anti-constitutional writings"". It is believed the four may be prisoners of conscience, detained for the non-violent exercise of their right to freedom of expression.
