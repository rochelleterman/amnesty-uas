 EXTRA 79/94 - Turkey: fear of torture: Zeynep Firat, Munevver Kuv | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Zeynap Firat, a member of the Istanbul Bar Association, is in custody in Istanbul Police Headquarters. Fears for her safety have been greatly increased by her claims that she was severely beaten on arrest and has since been tortured. Munevver Kuv, the client Zeynap Firat was going to see at the time of her arrest, has also been detained and is feared to be at risk of torture in incommunicado detention."
