 The six former senators named above remain in detention awaiting trial. They are prisoners of conscience. They were arrested between 2 and 6 June 1994 and charged on 14 June with ""treasonable felony"" and conspiracy. These charges relate to a secret meeting of former members of the Senate and the subsequent publication on 1 June of a statement urging General Sani Abacha, the head of state, to stand down and calling for the restoration of democratic institutions. They are among hundreds of pro-democracy activists who have been imprisoned in recent weeks. Among those on bail awaiting trial are Chief Olusegun Osoba, Air Commodore (retd) Jonah Jang, Air Commodore (retd) Dan Suleiman and Beko Ransome-Kuti."
