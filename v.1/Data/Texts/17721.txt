 Israel/OT: Fear For Safety/Torture/Ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of more than one thousand Palestinians detained by Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), during the past week in military refugee camps and towns in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Some Palestinians have been reportedly tortured by being beaten or held for prolonged periods in painful positions. All detainees are reportedly being held in conditions which amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. A Military Order has just been issued denying access of detainees to lawyers.
