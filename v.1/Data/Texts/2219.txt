 At least 30 unarmed demonstrators were shot dead or died as a result of gunshot injuries inflicted when soldiers of the Ciskei Defence Force reportedly opened fire on an African National Congress (ANC) march. The march had been organized in protest at the repressive policies of the Ciskei leader; the marchers apparently intended to occupy administrative buildings in the capital, Bisho. They had obtained permission from a magistrates' court in Ciskei to hold a rally near Bisho. When a section of the marchers broke away and started to run towards Bisho, the soldiers allegedly opened fire without warning. AI is concerned that lethal force was used unnecessarily. AI is also concerned at reports of assault and harassment of Ciskei residents suspected of having participated in the march "
