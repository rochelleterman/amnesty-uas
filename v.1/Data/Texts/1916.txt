 Rwanda: Further information on fear for safety / fear of ill-treatment / arbitrary arrest / possible extrajudicial execution and new concern: possible prisoner of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Amiel Nkuriza, director of Intego and editor-in chief of the Le Partisan was arrested on 13 May 1997 in Kigali and is currently detained at the civilian prison at Kimironko. There is concern that he may have been arrested because of the perception of his newspaper as critical of the government and that he may be a prisoner of conscience. He has been arrested and subsequently released on at least three previous occasions in 1996 and 1997.
