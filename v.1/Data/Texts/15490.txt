 Russian Federation: ""Disappearance""/ Fear of torture and ill-treatment. Khamzat Osmaev (m), aged 50 | Amnesty International 
 Khamzat Osmaev has ""disappeared"" after he was detained on 12 January 2004 in the republic of Ingushetia, apparently by members of the Russian federal forces. Amnesty International fears that he may be tortured or ill-treated. About a year ago, Khamzat Osmaev was warned not to go to Chechnya, as there might be an FSB warrant for his arrest due to his alleged relationship with a known Chechen field commander.
