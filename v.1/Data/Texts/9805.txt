 Delma Banks, scheduled to be executed on 1 December 1992 in Texas, has had his execution postponed to 5 January 1993. The postponement was granted pending a hearing on the appeal filed by his attorneys. The appeal presents evidence that prosecutors in the jurisdiction where Banks was tried had systematically excluded black jurors on racial grounds for at least six years up to the time of his trial. Banks, black, was convicted in 1980 by an all-white jury of the murder of a white man. "
