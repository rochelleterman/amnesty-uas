 AI is concerned that the Attorney General's office is abusing new special powers to block bail applications and effect the arbitrary detention of leading members of POPCRU, a union of police and prison warders campaigning against discrimination. The six people named above were arrested and charged with ""intimidation"" in early March 1993; on 15 or 16 March 13 other POPCRU members were arrested and also charged with intimidation. Nine of those arrested have been denied the right to apply for bail. AI is concerned that they are victims of arbitrary detention, targeted because of their involvement in the POPCRU trade union. POPCRU has been involved in a dispute with the prison authorities at Pietermaritzburg Prison, Natal. "
