 Italy: Roma community forcibly evicted | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 City authorities in the Italian capital, Rome, have forcibly evicted a community of about 400 Roma people. The majority of these homeless people, numbering some 100 families, have occupied an abandoned factory nearby. If evicted from the factory, the families face living in harsh conditions at another makeshift camp, or may even be forced to live out in the open. "
