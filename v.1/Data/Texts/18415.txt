 Saudi Arabia: Death sentence: Rizana Nafeek (f)

 | Amnesty International 
 Domestic worker Rizana Nafeek, aged 19,  was sentenced to death on 16 June for a murder committed while she was 17 years old. Saudi Arabia is a state party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which expressly prohibits the execution of offenders for crimes committed when they were under 18 years old. Rizana Nafeek is believed to have appealed against her sentence, but if her appeal is unsuccessful she could be executed within days.
