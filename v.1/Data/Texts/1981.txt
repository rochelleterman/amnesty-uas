 Sierra Leone: Torture or ill-treatment / probable prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Brima S. Massaquoi, chaiman of Kenema town council; Brima Kpaka, businessman; Swaray Kokowa, retired local government officer; Dr Momoh, medical doctor; Dr Stevens, medical doctor; a man known as ""Potor Potor"" and several others: At least 10 community members from the town of Kenema in Sierra Leone's Eastern Province, including the above-named individuals, have been arrested. They are suspected of supporting a civil defence force composed of local hunters, known as the kamajors, who support the previous government ousted in a military coup in May 1997. AI is seriously concerned for the safety of these detainees as it appears that some of them have been tortured and ill-treated.
