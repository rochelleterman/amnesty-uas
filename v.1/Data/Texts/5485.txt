 The above-named 19 people were arrested by members of the security forces in Havana on 6 August 1994 in an apparent round-up of government critics and human rights activists. The authorities have acknowledged that some 300 people are in detention in connection with events during the preceding day or so but unofficial reports suggest that some 500 people may have been arrested. AI is calling for the immediate and unconditional release of these people."
