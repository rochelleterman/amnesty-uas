 India: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Police opened fire on a protest march in Maharashtra, western India, on 25 June, killing three people and injuring 37. Fifteen adivasi activists, including John and Rina Abraham were arrested and charged with the attempted murder of a policeman and attempt to commit arson. Amnesty International believes the charges are without foundation, part of a pattern of harassment of adivasis campaigning for land rights, and fears that all 15 are at risk of torture or ill-treatment.
