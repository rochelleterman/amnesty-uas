 Uzbekistan: Further information on fear for safety / incommunicado detention: Rashid Bekzhon | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that Rashid Bekzhon    faces an unfair trial on charges including ""threatening   the constitutional order"" and ""organizing a criminal      conspiracy"".  Amnesty International believes he  may have been charged solely because he is a brother of   Muhammad Salih, the exiled leader of the banned                    democratic opposition party Erk.
