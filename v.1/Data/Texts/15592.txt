 Russian Federation (Chechnya): Fear of torture and ill-treatment / Incommunicado detention - Taisa Isayeva   (f), journalist | Amnesty International 
 Chechen journalist Taisa Isayeva was reportedly arrested  by Russian forces on 2 June when she tried to cross the   border from North Ossetia in the Russian Federation, into Georgia. Amnesty International is extremely concerned     that she may be held incommunicado at a secret            ""filtration camp"", where she would be at high risk of     torture and ill-treatment.
