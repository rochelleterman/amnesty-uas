 This update to MDE 24/054/2005 reports that Mamun         al-Humsi has ended his hunger-strike and has returned     from Tishrin Military Prison to 'Adra Prison but          continues to be held incommunicado. Amnesty International is extremely concerned about the continuing health        problems of Mamun al-Humsi and Riad Seif. Both men are    now being held with criminal prisoners and have           reportedly suffered threats of violence from their fellow inmates. 'Aref Dalilah is not on hunger strike and has    not been on hunger strike in recent times. However, he is reportedly in very poor health and suffers from heart     problems."
