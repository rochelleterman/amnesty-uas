 Samuel B Asigha, Michael Doghala, Adam Kaa, Sampson Ntignee, John Banatu, Godwin B Gbodor, Benjamin Kabari, Nwinbari Abere Papah, Kagbara Bassee, Friday Gburuma, Baritule Lebe, Babina Vizor, Paul Deekor, Blessing Israel, Nyieda Nasikpo, Popgbara Zorzor, Ngbaa Baovi, Baribuma Kumanwee, Taaghalobari Kovabel Monsi and possibly two others: On 19 August 1997, a group of at least 19 Ogoni prisoners held in Port Harcourt prison, announced that they had begun a hunger-strike to ""protest against the government's decision to stall court proceedings"" against them. Most of the detainees have been held without trial since 1994. AI is seriously concerned for their well-being, given that many are already in poor health due to the very poor conditions in which they continue to be held.
