 Algeria: Incommunicado detention/fear of torture or other ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 The UK authorities deported two Algerian men, known as ""V"" and ""I"", to Algeria on 16 and 17 June respectively, on the grounds that they presented a ""threat to the national security"" of the UK. The men's families have had no contact with them since they arrived at Algiers airport, and Amnesty International fears that they are being held in a military barracks in Algiers, part of which is used as a secret detention centre, and that they are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment.
