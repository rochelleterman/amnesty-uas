 Political violence in the Gaza Strip (Palestinian Authority - PA) is escalating, reaching unprecedented levels in recent days, and is putting the civilian population more and more at risk. Some 130 Palestinians have been killed and several hundreds injured in the past month alone in clashes between the security forces and their proxy militias loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah party or to Prime Minister Isma'il Haniyeh's Hamas party.
