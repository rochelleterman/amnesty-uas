 UA 321/93 - Haiti: extrajudicial execution / fear for safety: Antoine Izmery, Fritz / Antoine Jocelyn, two other political activists | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 11 September 1993 Antoine Izmery was dragged out of the Sacre Coeur de Turgeau Church in Port-au-Prince and shot dead by gunmen, described by some sources as plainclothes policemen. According to witnesses, uniformed policemen passed by the church minutes before and after the attack, but did nothing to intervene. Antoine Izmery was attending a mass to commemorate the fifth anniversary of an attack on Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1988. Armed men also reportedly beat Aristide supporters outside the church. Three hours later Fritz/Antoine Jocelyn was shot dead by armed men in Petionville. The attacks take place in the context of a recent wave of violence as the date of President Aristide's return to power draws nearer. "
