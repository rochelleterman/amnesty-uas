 Israel/Occupied Territories: Further information on house demolition  

 | Amnesty International 
 At the beginning of January 2006 the Jerusalem District Court issued an injunction lifting the threat of imminent demolition from the home of Zarifa and Mohammed Abbasi, aged 76 and 78. The elderly couple can therefore continue to live in their home while they try to obtain a building permit for the house, as mandated by the court.
