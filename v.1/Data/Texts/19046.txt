"Tunisia: ""Disappearance"" / fear of torture / prisoner of conscience: Amar Amroussia 
 NA 
 Amar Amroussia, aged 37, a primary school teacher from Gafsa, has been held in secret detention since his arrest on 13 January 1997. The Public Prosecutor in Gabes has denied all knowledge of his case. He is believed to be a prisoner of conscience and there are grave fears for his safety given the continuing practice in Tunisia of subjecting suspected political opposition activists to torture and ill-treatment during secret detention. These fears are heightened by the fact that he is in poor-health, suffering from a broken eardrum and nose for which he was shortly to undergo an operation.
