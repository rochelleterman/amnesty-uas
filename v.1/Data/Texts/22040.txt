 Roxana Saberi, who is a dual US-Iranian national, was sentenced to eight yearsâ€™ imprisonment after being convicted of espionage on 18 April 2009. Amnesty International believes she is a prisoner of conscience, held either for political reasons related to Iran-US relations or for the peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of expression. She should be released immediately and without condition."
