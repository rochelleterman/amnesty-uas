 AI is concerned that seven military officers accused of planning a coup could be executed after unfair trials before a military court. The above are accused of plotting to overthrow the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC) and are expected to be brought soon before a court-martial charged with treason.  If convicted they could face the death penalty. AI fears that if the death sentences are passed, they could be carried out quickly."
