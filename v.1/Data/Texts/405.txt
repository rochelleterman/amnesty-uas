 Cameroon: Further information on prisoner of conscience / health concern / cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment: Pius Njawe, journalist, director of Le Messager | Amnesty International 
 Pius Njaw?'s appeal against his conviction and sentence resulted in the reduction of his sentence to one year's imprisonment.Amnesty International is therefore repeating its call for his immediate and unconditional release amid serious concerns for his health and safety while in detention.  Prison conditions in Cameroon deny basic rights and often amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Pius Njaw? was arrested following an article in Le Messager and was charged with dissemination of false news. Michel Michaut Moussala who was sentenced for defamation at the same trial has not yet been arrested and imprisoned.
