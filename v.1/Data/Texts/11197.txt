 India / Bhutan: Imminent extradition / fear of torture: Rongthong Kunley Dorji | Amnesty International 
 There is concern that Rongthong Kunley Dorji, a 58-year-old Bhutanese national, could be at risk of torture if returned to Bhutan. He is the chairman of the United Front for Democracy (UFD) in Bhutan, a political organization in exile, and was arrested by police at its offices in New Delhi on 18 April. He is believed to have been arrested after the Indian authorities received an extradition request from the Bhutanese authorities, after the High Court of Bhutan recently issued a warrant for his arrest. To date he has not been provided with any documents outlining the grounds for his arrest. There is concern that the charges against him are politically motivated. He was arrested in May 1991 on charges of treason and was allegedly tortured by members of the Royal Bhutan Bodyguards.
