 EXTRA 78/92 - USA (Texas): death penalty: eight executions scheduled in seven day period | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Eight executions are scheduled to take place in Texas in the period from 17-24 September 1992. This is the largest number of executions scheduled by a single state within a 7 day period since the reintroduction of the death penalty by US states in the mid-1970s. AI is deeply concerned at the escalating rate at which death sentences are being issued and carried out in Texas; the organization urges that the sentences be commuted. Those scheduled to be executed are: David Long (white), Irineo Montoya (Mexican), Cornelius Goss (black), Karl Hammond (black), Warren Bridge (white), James Demouchette (black), Andre Lewis (black), Ricardo Aldape Guerra (Mexican).
