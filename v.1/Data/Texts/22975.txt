 Qassim ‘Askar Jubran, Ahmad Muhammad Ba Mu’allam and Fadi Ba’oom are being held in incommunicado detention, possibly at the Political Security Prison in Sana’a, where they are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Amnesty International is concerned that they may be prisoners of conscience, held solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly."
