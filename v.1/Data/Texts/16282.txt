 The above named six men, who went on trial in the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan on 1 July 1993 face a minimum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment and possibly the death penalty. They would be prisoners of conscience if convicted. They are charged under Article 62 of the criminal code, relating to their membership of a non-violent social organization-in-formation called Milli Mejlis (National Council). Babur Shakirov, Khazratkul Khudayberdi and Salavat Umurzakov are currently in detention and are already considered to be prisoners of conscience. "
