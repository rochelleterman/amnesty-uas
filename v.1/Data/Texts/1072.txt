"Kenya: Fear of ill treatment/possible prisoners of conscience 
 Kenya: Fear of ill treatment/possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Seventy-one members and supporters of the Kenyan human rights lobbying group, Release Political Prisoners (RPP), were arrested on 20 October 2001. Seventy of them have been remanded to prison, where torture and ill-treatment are rife. Some are said to have been beaten. Amnesty International is concerned for their safety, and believes they may be prisoners of conscience, detained solely because of their non-violent political beliefs.
