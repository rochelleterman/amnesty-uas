 UA 129/93 - Philippines: unacknowledged detention / fear of ""disappearance"": Ricky Bero, Julio Rapol | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ricky Bero and Julio Rapol, a 57-year-old farmer, have ""disappeared"" after being arrested on 18 March 1993 by a combined team of the Philippines National Police and members of the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAFGU) in Villa Pag-asa, Bansud, Oriental Mindoro. Ricky Bero was reportedly arrested on suspicion of being a member of the NPA and asked to contact Julio Rapol, with whom he was reportedly staying. Julio Rapol reportedly asked the PNP/CAFGU to report Ricky Bero's arrest to the barangay captain but this request was refused and he was also arrested. The provincial governor has written to the PNP command, requesting an investigation into the ""disappearances"". "
