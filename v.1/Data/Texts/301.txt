 Burundi: Fear for safety: Anastase Uwizera | Amnesty International 
 Anastase Uwizera, a deacon of the Roman Catholic church, has not been seen since 24 September 1996 when he was reportedly abducted by members of the Forces for the Defence of Democracy, the armed wing of the National Council for the Defence of Democracy. He is a member of the majority Hutu ethnic group and was reportedly accused of collaborating with government soldiers. Amnesty International fears that he may be tortured or killed.
