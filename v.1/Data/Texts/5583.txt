 UA 402/92 - Cuba: fear of ill-treatment / legal concern: Gustavo Arcos Bergnes, Francisco Chaviano Gonzalez, Rene del Pozo Pozo, Angela Herrera, Alvaro Prendes, Vladimiro Roca, Paula Valiente | Amnesty International

 As of 16 December 1992, the homes of Gustavo Arcos Bergnes, Francisco Chaviano Gonzalez, Angela Herrera, Alvaro Prendes and Vladimiro Roca, all members of unofficial political and human rights groups, were said to be under siege by large pro-government mobs, many of whom apparently belong to so-called ""Rapid Response Brigades"". Paula Valiente, president of the Association of Mothers for Dignity, was reportedly arrested when she attempted to visit Angela Herrera. None of those besieged in their homes have been able to leave their houses and Vladimiro Roca and Alvaro Prendes have reportedly had their water, gas and electricity cut off. It is believed that the authorities are trying to put pressure on members of dissident groups to give up their activities. "
