 India: Further information on: Death threats / fear for safety: Peer Noor ul Haq | Amnesty International 
 AI continues to have concern for the safety of Peer Noor ul Haq. Since he came forward as a witness to the murder of three detainees, police have threatened to kill him unless he decides not to testify. Both the State Human Rights Commission and the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir have ordered that he receive police protection, but no such protection has ever been provided. Amnesty International will be taking up the case of Ghulam Matto, Javid Shah and Nazir Gilkar in a longer-term campaign.
