 Tunisia: Further information on fear of torture or ill-treatment / ""disappearance"" / prisoner of conscience: Abdel Moumen Belanes | Amnesty International 
 Abdel Moumen Belanes, a student arrested on 6 March 1997, was transferred on 10 March to the 9 Avril prison in Tunis. He was reportedly threatened with torture during secret detention. His lawyer, who saw him for the first time since his arrest on 11 March, had requested that he undergo a medical examination. However, no examination is known to have taken place to date. Amnesty International is continuing to call for his immediate and unconditional release as a prisoner of conscience.
