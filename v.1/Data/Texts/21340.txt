 Spain: Fear of forcible return/Fear of torture or other ill-treatment: Murad Gasayev (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Spanish authorities are preparing to extradite ethnic Chechen Murad Gasayev to the Russian Federation, where he would be at risk of an unfair trial, torture and other ill-treatment.  If the extradition goes ahead, it will violate Spainâ€™s obligations under international human rights law, including the UN Convention against Torture."
