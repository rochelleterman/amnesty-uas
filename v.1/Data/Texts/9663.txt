 USA: Legal concern / Death penalty / Health concern	 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International remains concerned for the mental health of six men held in solitary confinement in US military custody in Guant‡namo Bay, Cuba. The six are the only prisoners so far made subject to the Military Order on the Detention, Treatment and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism signed by President Bush on 13 November 2001. Those held under the Order can be detained indefinitely without charge or trial. They can also be brought to trial before military commissions whose verdicts, including death sentences, cannot be appealed in any court. Two of the six, Ali Hamza Ahmed Sulayman al Bahlul and Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi have been charged with conspiracy to commit war crime and ""terrorism"". No dates for their trials have been set.
