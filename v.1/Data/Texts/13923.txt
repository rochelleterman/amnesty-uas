 53-year-old Jehovah's Witness Theocharis Theokli Theocharidis faces trial on 22 April 1994 for refusing to perform reservist military exercises. He faces a possible prison term of between one to five months. He served a two-month prison sentence in June 1991, paid a fine in November 1991, and was given a three-month suspended sentence on 8 January 1992. He has extremely poor eye-sight, and suffers from enlargement of the high and high blood pressure. His applications for exemption from military obligations on health grounds have not been accepted so far. If he is imprisoned again, he will be considered a prisoner of conscience."
