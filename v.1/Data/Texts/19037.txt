 Political prisoner Hachemi Mekki, aged 48, is reportedly being denied access to adequate medical treatment. His life may be at risk if he does not receive specialist care in hospital. He was transferred from the 9 avril prison in the capital, Tunis, to Ariana hospital, just outside Tunis, on 3 February 2006, but the prison authorities have not permitted him to receive the treatment he needs.
