 NA 
 Juan Manuel Martínez is currently detained in Santa Maria Ixcotel state prison, where he is at risk of torture or ill-treatment in order to force him to confess the 2006 murder of US videojournalist Brad Will. Amnesty International is also concerned that he may not be granted adequate access to a lawyer of his choice and members of his family. "
