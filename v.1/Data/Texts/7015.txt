 Honduras: Fear for safety/Medical concern | Amnesty International 
 Indigenous community leader Feliciano Pineda was attacked and seriously injured on 5 June, by four men with machetes believed to be linked to a local powerful landowning family. He was taken to hospital, but arrested there, and is now in prison, where his wounds are reportedly seriously infected and he is unable to eat. He is reportedly not receiving the medical attention he was prescribed and his life could be in danger if he does not receive treatment. Amnesty International believes the charges against him, which include murder, are fabricated. Other indigenous leaders in the same community are facing similar charges, and they too are in danger. The attackers also reportedly threatened to kill Feliciano's wife if she did not leave the area.
