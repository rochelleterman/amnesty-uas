"Syria: Fear of torture and other ill-treatment/incommunicado detention/forcible return/medical concern 
 NA 
 The two Syrian Kurdish men (Yassin Suleiman, (m), aged 35 and his father, name not known, aged over 60) were apparently detained on 21 December.  They are believed to be held incommunicado, reportedly by State Security (Amn al-Dawla), which puts them at grave risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Their arrest appears to be connected to Yassin Suleiman's alleged membership of the unauthorized Kurdish Democratic Progressive Party.
