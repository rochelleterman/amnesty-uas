 Syria / Hungary: Fear of refoulement / fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Anthony Zakaria Laki and Samuel Lado Zakaria, Sudanese asylum-seekers: Amnesty International has learned with grave concern that within the next few days the above mentioned may be forcibly returned from  Syria to Sudan where they would be at serious risk of detention and torture, after having had their claims for asylum in Hungary rejected, and were expelled within  a matter of days to Syria, the country through which they had travelled. Since then they have been in detention in Syria, mainly in Yarmuk immigration prison. If carried out, the forcible expulsion would be a grave violation of the internationally recognised principle of non-refoulement.
