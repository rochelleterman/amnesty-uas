 | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International continues to campaign against the   large-scale destruction by the Israeli army and security  forces of houses, land and property belonging to          Palestinians and Israeli Arabs in Israel and the Occupied Territories. The organization also continues to oppose    the widespread violations of the right to adequate        housing and a decent standard of living for tens of       thousands of people affected by the destruction, which    violates fundamental principles of international human    rights and humanitarian law.
