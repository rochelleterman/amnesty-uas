"USA (Georgia) : Death penalty / Legal concern for   Alexander Edmund Williams 
 USA (Georgia) : Death penalty / Legal concern for   Alexander Edmund Williams | Amnesty International 
 Alexander Williams is scheduled to be put to death in Georgia's electric chair  for a murder  committed when    he was 17 years old. International law forbids the use of the death penalty for crimes committed by those    under  18. If executed, Alex Williams would   become   the fifth child offender put to death in the USA   this   year,     more than the total combined number of such executions in the rest of the world since August 1993.
