 The hearing of the Collegium of the Supreme Court of      Kazakstan on 17 December will be the last chance for      Mikhail Vershinin, Evgeniy Turochkin and Sergey Kopay to  have their death sentences reviewed by a court. If their  appeal against the death sentences is unsuccessful, their only hope will be to ask the President to grant them      clemency.
