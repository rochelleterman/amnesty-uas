 Shortly after the shooting of Bilal Ahmed and his parents on 1 August 1993, a sub-inspector of the Border Security Force was suspended from duty and then arrested. The government announced that there would be a court of inquiry into these deaths, and that the Crime Branch would also investigate the killings. A magesterial inquiry was ordered three days later, but its results are not yet known. So far it appears that no inquiry has been initiated into the killings of demonstrators on 2 and 3 August. "
