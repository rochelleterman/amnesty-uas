 Brazil: Fear for safety/Sexual Violence | Amnesty International 
 The Guarani Kaiowæ community of Nhanderu Marangatu in the Antonio Jo¨o municipality, Mato Grosso do Sul state, are in imminent risk of danger. Around 30 private security guards working for local landowners have repeatedly threatened the community by firing shots in the air. The security guards have also been accused of raping three indigenous women so far this year. The atmosphere of constant fear and intimidation is preventing the Guarani Kaiowæ from going about their daily lives.
