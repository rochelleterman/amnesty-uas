 On 8 May, 8 men of the Tzeltal indigenous community of San Sebastian Bachajón, Chiapas state, were committed for trial. Since then charges against one of the men, Miguel Vázquez Moreno, have been dropped. However the remaining 7 men may be tried on the basis of statements taken after they had been tortured and threatened."
