 USA (New Hampshire):Further information to Bill to abolish the death penalty 

 | Amnesty International 
 On 19 May 2000, the Governor of New Hampshire vetoed the  bill, passed by the Senate and House of Representatives,  to abolish the death penalty. Although Governor Shaheen's veto could be overridden by a two-thirds vote in the      House of Representatives and Senate, it is unclear if     sufficient votes could be generated for such a move and   whether they will be sought at this stage.
