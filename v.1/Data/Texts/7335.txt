 UA 332/94 - Mexico: arbitrary killing / fear for safety: Roberto Hernandez Paniagua, Enrique Murias | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Roberto Hernandez Paniagua, a schoolteacher and municipal leader of the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), was shot dead on 6 September 1994 in the town of Jaltenango de la Paz, state of Chiapas. The same day another PRD municpal leader, Enrique Murias, was arbitrarily detained by members of the federal judicial police in the town of Mapastepec. Although he was later released, there are now fears for his safety. These incidents follow a series of reported acts of harassment against members of the opposition PRD since the general elections of 21 August 1994."
