 Albert Mukesha Batwaro, Rwandese; from Guinea-Conakry: Souleymane Diallo, Sulaymane Soure, Alpha Mamadou Barry, Abubacar Sall; and other African nationals: On 20 August 1996, 46 men of various African nationalities, detained in Guinea-Bissau after being deported from Spain in mid-June, resumed their hunger-strike amidst reports that the authorities were making arrangements to repatriate 40 of them and to find other countries of asylum for the one Rwandese and five Liberians. AI is calling on all relevant authorities to address their legitimate grievances as they did not have adequate opportunity to present their claims for asylum in Spain or Guinea-Bissau.
