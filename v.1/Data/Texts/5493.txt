 Juvencio Padron Duenas has reportedly received death threats from a prison warder. His health continues to cause concern: at the time of arrest in September 1994 he was reportedly suffering from a brain haemorrhage and is now said to suffer severe headaches. He has reportedly been denied proper medical assistance in detention. Juvencio Padron Duenas has now been held without trial for nearly a year and has reportedly seen his lawyer only once during this time. He was charged with the three others named above with the murder and robbery of two elderly people. AI has received serious allegations that the real motive for hs arrest may be political. AI is calling for him to receive proper medical care and for him to be tried promptly and fairly. AI also calls for the death threats against him to be investigated."
