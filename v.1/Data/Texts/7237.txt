 There are fears for the safety of Marisa Kramsky Espinosa, a political activist, and her family, who have reported receiving anonymous telephone threats. The threats indicate that they will suffer aggression and violence if they do not stop supporting Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who has been mediating in the conflict between the Mexican Government and the EZLN."
