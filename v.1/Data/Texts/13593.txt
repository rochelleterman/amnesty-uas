 UA 237/93 - Taiwan: death penalty / treatment in detention: Chou Wei-cheng | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Chou Wei-cheng was sentenced to death by Taipei District Court on 12 July 1993 for kidnapping and holding to ransom businessman Hsu Ming-chuan. Two co-defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment. Like all prisoners under sentence of death, he is believed to be permanently kept in iron feet shackles, a practice which constitutes degrading and inhuman treatment. "
