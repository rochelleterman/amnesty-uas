 Saudi Arabia: Alarming increase in number of executions | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is gravely concerned at the sharp increase in the number of executions in Saudi Arabia. At least 90 people were executed between 20 January and 19 April 1995. this is the highest number of executions recorded by AI to have taken place in such a short period in Saudi Arabia. Most of those executed were convicted of murder or drug offences. AI is seeking information about the case of seven Somali nationals, reportedly sentenced to death in 1994 for crimes that they allegedly did not commit. Those executed included a woman, convicted of sexual offences and chewing qat."
