 Syria: Health concern / prisoner of conscience: Faraj Ahmad Birqdar | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Faraj Ahmad Birqdar, a long-term prisoner of conscience, is reportedly being denied adequate medical care for serious injuries sustained as a result of torture in pre-trial incommunicado detention. He was arrested in 1987 and held incommunicado for almost seven years before being sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment by a Supreme State Security Court (SSSC). AI believes that SSSC procedures fall far short of international standards for fair trial."
