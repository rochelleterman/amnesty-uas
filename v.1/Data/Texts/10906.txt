 Ten people, including Qian Changxiong, Chen Shiwen and    Liu Guxing, are at risk of imminent execution. On 10      September the High People's Court of Hebei province,      northern China, reportedly rejected their appeals and     upheld their death sentences, passed earlier this year on charges of human trafficking. Executions can take place   within hours after the appeal has been rejected and the   death sentence confirmed.
