 Human rights defenders Brice Mackosso (m) and Christian Mounzâo (m) were detained on 7 April, apparently because of their human rights work, which has included investigating and denouncing embezzlement of oil revenues by government officials. They are held at the central prison in the country's economic capital, Pointe-Noire, where they are at risk of torture to reveal their sources of information in connection with their human rights work. Torture and other forms of ill-treatment are frequently practised in Congolese detention centres.
