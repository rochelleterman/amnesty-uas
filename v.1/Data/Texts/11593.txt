 Muchtar Pakpahan was released from detention on 20 May 1995 by the Indonesian Supreme Court. Under Indonesian law a detainee must be released from detention if an appeal to the Supreme Court remains undecided after 110 days. If the Supreme Court ultimately decides against him he could be returned to jail. Amosi Telaumbanua remains in prison as a prisoner of conscience."
