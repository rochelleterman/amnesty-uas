 The people listed above were arrested by military police on 21 March 1994 during a raid on two communities in the municipality of Eldorado do Carajas. AI is concerned that the arrests may be part of a pattern of continuing harassment of rural workers and their representatives in the context of a local land dispute. There have been allegations that the first three men named above have been ill-treated in detention."
