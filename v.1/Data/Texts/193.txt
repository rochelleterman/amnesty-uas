 Burundi: Arbitrary detention/Prisoner of conscience: TÃ©rence Nahimana (m)


 | Amnesty International 
 Peace activist T‰rence Nahimana is facing charges that could potentially see him jailed for up to 20 years. The government has recently been harassing and intimidating human rights defenders, especially those who criticise it, and Amnesty International is concerned that numerous other people are now at risk of imprisonment simply for exercising their right to freedom of expression.
