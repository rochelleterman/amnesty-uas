 In a press conference on 12 June 1995, Dr Julio Eduardo Arango Escobar reportedly announced that he had continued to receive death threats. He nonetheless stated that he would continue to press for exhumation of the site where Efrain Bamarca may have been buried. Exhumation of the site was rescheduled for 13 June but by morning of 14 June permission to exhume the site had not arrived. Also, it has been reported that the Ministry of Defence is prepared to authorize only one day of work to exhume the site, which is reportedly the size of two soccer fields."
