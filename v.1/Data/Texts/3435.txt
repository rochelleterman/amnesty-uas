 Democratic Republic of Congo: Fear for safety / arbitrary arrest | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of the  two independent journalists, Mushizi Nfundiko Kizito and  Omba Kamengele,  who were arrested on 25 August 1999 by   soldiers of an armed       opposition group. They were    apparently arrested because they were suspected  of using their radio receiver to listen in on sensitive   military transmissions. However there are concerns that   their    arrest might be politically motivated.
