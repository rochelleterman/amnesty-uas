 EXTRA 77/92 - Ukraine: fear of imminent execution: Viktor Petrovich Gorokhov | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Unofficial sources have informed AI that the President of Ukraine has turned down the petition for clemency lodged by Viktor Petrovich Gorokhov, a young farm worker from southern Ukraine who was convicted of the murder of his parents-in-law. He reportedly gave himself up after the murders and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital for treatment. He apparently has no previous convictions. AI is concerned that his execution may be imminent and is urging President Kravchuk to reconsider his decision not to grant clemency to Viktor Gorokhov. "
