 NA 
 A court in Saudi Arabia is reported to be considering Sri Lankan domestic worker Rizana Nafeek's appeal against her death sentence. If the sentence is upheld, she could be at imminent risk of execution. This concern is heightened as the rate of executions has increased in 2008, with at least 25 people, including three women, executed since 8 January 2008."
