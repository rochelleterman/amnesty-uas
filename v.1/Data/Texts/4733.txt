 Members of the Arauca teachers' union ASEDAR have reportedly received death threats in recent weeks. On 5 April 1994 teacher Juan Carlos Parales was killed in circumstances which are still unclear; on 9 April gunmen attempted to kill Elbano Antonio Rojas, seriously wounding him. Forty-three of the union's members have reportedly received death threats but no steps have been taken by the authorities to investigate any of these violations."
