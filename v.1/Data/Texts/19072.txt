 Tunisia: Further information on fear of torture / legal concern and new concern: fear of imprisonment as a prisoner of conscience: Tahir Zouinekh | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Tahir Zouinekh was finally brought before a court on 15 March 1995, 79 days after his arrest. There are grounds for fearing that he may have been tortured during this excessively long period of incommunicado detention. Furthermore, AI fears that when the verdict on his case is announced (expected 30 March 1995), he may face imprisonment as a prisoner of conscience. Not all the charges against him are known but they include membership of an unauthorized organization (believed to be the Islamist movement al-Nahda)."
