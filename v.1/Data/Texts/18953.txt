 Morocco: Prisoner of conscience / ill-treatment: Khadija Benameur (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Khadija Benameur, a trade unionist arrested whilst taking part in a peaceful protest, was sentenced on 20 March 1995 to one year's imprisonment. Her appeal hearing is imminent but no date has been set. She is one of a group of six workers arrested on 14 March 1995. AI considers her to be a prisoner of conscience, who should be released immediately. AI is also concerned that she and two co-defendants were severely ill-treated in police detention after their arrest."
