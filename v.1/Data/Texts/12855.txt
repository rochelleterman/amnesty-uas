 Pakistan: Further information on fear for safety / death penalty: John Joseph, Salamat Masih aged 14, Rehmat Masih | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Salamat Masih and Rehmat Masih were acquitted of the charge of blasphemy on 23 February 1995, overturning a death sentence imposed on 9 February. AI welcomes their acquittal but continues to be concerned for their safety. AI is urging the Pakistan Government to provide adequate protection for them when they are released from jail. Others involved in the case - family members, lawyers, judges and human rights activists - have also received threats. AI is calling for them to be protected. AI continues to urge the government to introduce legislation which would prevent further abuse of the blasphemy law."
