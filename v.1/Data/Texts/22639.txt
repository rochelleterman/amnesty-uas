 'Abdullah Saleh al-Muhanna, a retired mayor of al-Khober, a city in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, is being detained in al- Khober Police Station after holding Friday prayers at his home for members of the Shi’a community. On 25 May, he was asked by the police to present himself at the police station and was arrested upon arrival there. He is detained because he refused to sign an undertaking not to hold prayers at home again. Amnesty International considers 'Abdullah Saleh al-Muhanna to be a prisoner of conscience."
