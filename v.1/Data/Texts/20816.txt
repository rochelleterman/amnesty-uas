 Zhang Shanguang, former teacher and trade union activist, has reportedly been transferred from Prison Number 1 in   Hunan Province to a hospital in Jinshi. His transfer to   hospital indicates that Zhang Shanguang's health has      deteriorated. He is believed to have tuberculosis and     despite being ill, was reportedly forced to do heavy      physical work in fetters. Since July 1998, when he was    re-arrested, Zhang has reportedly been prevented from     taking any medication to treat his tuberculosis           infection.."
