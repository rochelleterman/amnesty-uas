 On 14 June 1993, the security forces raided the predominantly Christian village of Gorumlu, Sirnak province, in retaliation for a raid on the gendarmerie post there by PKK (Kurdish Workers' Party) guerrillas on 12 June. The six men named above were detained during the operation, but the authorities have denied their detention. According to a petition which the wife of Hamdi Simsek submitted to the authorities in Sirnak, the security forces threatened the village imam and the villagers, and allegedly tortured the men in the village in front of their relatives.
