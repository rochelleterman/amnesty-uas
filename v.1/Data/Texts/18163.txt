"Oman: Fear of torture/prisoners of conscience 
 Oman: Fear of torture/prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Hundreds of people, mainly academics and religious figures, are reported to have been detained in mass arrests since the beginning of this year. At least 100, including those named above, are held incommunicado, which puts them at risk of torture. Amnesty International is concerned that many may be prisoners of conscience, held solely for the non-violent expression of their beliefs.
