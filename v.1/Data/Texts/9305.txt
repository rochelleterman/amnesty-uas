"USA (Illinois): death penalty: Girvies Davis 
 USA (Illinois): death penalty: Girvies Davis | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Girvies Davis, black, is scheduled to be executed in Illinois on 17 May 1995, despite doubts about his guilt of the crime for which he was sentenced to death. The principle evidence in three of the four murder charges against him were pre-written confessions which he was allegedly forced to sign. According to records Davis was illiterate and was diagnosed as having an ""organic brain disorder"" and was mentally retarded. Since the initial trial, the prosecution has conceded that at least three of the murders to which he confessed were committed by other people. During the prosecution's arguments that the death penalty should be imposed, these other murders were cited to show a pattern and justify a death sentence. He was tried before an all-white jury, who were unaware that he could not have written his confession or that he could not have read the confessions he signed. Davis has consistently maintained his innocence of any of the murders. There is also concern at an eyewitness's testimony."
