 UA 313/92 - Guatemala: death threats / intimidation: members of the Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios (AEU) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned for the safety of members of the AEU and of students involved in court proceedings against the Hunapu, the Guatemalan special security force unit. A bomb exploded outside AEU offices on 5 October 1992; it followed a series of death threats and attempts to intimidate members of the union involved in a legal action against the Hunapu, who were responsible for the killing of student Julio Cu Quim earlier this year. AI is also concerned about reports of a second bomb exploding at the offices of the weekly magazine Tinamit, which has published articles critical of the government. "
