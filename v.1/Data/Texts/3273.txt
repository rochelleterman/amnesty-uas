"Zaire: Torture / legal concern 
 Zaire: Torture / legal concern | Amnesty International 
 There is serious concern at reports that four people held by the military in Goma are being tortured. The four, Malira Kabuya, Byamungu Kahima, Ndasimwa Malira and Bonane, were arrested with five other civilians on 29 January 1996. Three men, Kahima, Kamulete Ngabo and Bahati Basimolerwa, have already died as a result of torture. Two others, Luanda Kibaho and Muhindo Mawazo have been admitted to hospital. There are fears they may be redetained when they are discharged.
