 NA 
 Approximately 3,000 people have been forcibly evicted from their homes in Githogoro village, in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. The evictions were carried out without adequate notice or any consultation with the affected people. Many have been left without shelter, some living in the rubble of their former homes, and without access to clean water, sanitation and health care."
