 Syria: Prisoner of conscience/fear of torture/incommunicado detention, Habib Salih

 | Amnesty International 
 Habib Salih has been held incommunicado without charge since 29 May. He is at grave risk of torture. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience, as he appears to have been arrested solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression by publishing articles critical of the government.
