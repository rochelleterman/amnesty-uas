 Russia: Further information on Health concern/Denial of medical treatment: Mikhail Ivanovich Trepashkin (m), lawyer | Amnesty International 
 On 9 March, a district court in Nizhnii Tagil decided     that  Mikhail Trepashkin should be transferred to a       standard    prison colony, which has a stricter regime    than the open  prison colony he used to be in. After his  transfer,       Mikhail Trepashkin has restricted access  to his family,   friends, lawyers and supporters. In      addition, he may be   at risk of further violations of    his human rights         including the continuing denial  of adequate medical       treatment which may lead to a   further decline of his      health.
