 Sudan: Fear for Safety/Torture or other ill-treatment: Over one million internally displaced persons in Darfur | Amnesty International 
 The Sudanese government is attempting to force villagers who have fled their homes in Darfur, western Sudan, to return to their villages from the camps and settlements around towns in Darfur where they are living. They are already being attacked in the camps where they are receiving some humanitarian and medical aid, but are in danger of starvation or further attacks by government-backed militias if they return to their villages. Over a million people are in danger.
