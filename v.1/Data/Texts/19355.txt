 Yemen: Fear for safety/risk of extrajudicial execution,   Badr al-Dhubai | Amnesty International 
 Armed tribesmen have kidnapped eight-year-old Badr al-Dhubai to force his father to drop legal proceedings against one of their tribe. Amnesty International believes Badr al-Dhubai's life is in danger, and is concerned that the police appear to have failed in their duty to secure his release.
