 Ethiopia: Further information on possible prisoners of conscience/ fear of torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 CUD members, officials, representatives and candidates Birkayehu Mekecha (m), Dache Molla (m), Emkulu Yiheyis (m), Endrias Ero (m), Hailemichael Zijita (m), Solomon Tenaye (m), Tefera Mengeste (m), Tesfaye Tarekegne (m), Wendwossen Shiferraw (m), Yohannes Abate (m), and hundreds of other members of opposition parties were released in early October. However, the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD), claims that over 800 of its members are still detained in different regions, and says that it will call for peaceful strikes and demonstrations if they are not released quickly. The United Ethiopian Democratic Front (UEDF) opposition coalition has said some of its members in the Oromia and southern regions are still detained. The opposition party members detained may be prisoners of conscience, arrested solely for the non-violent expression of their political opinions.
