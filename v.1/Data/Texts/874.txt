 Ethiopia: Further information on medical concern / prisoner of conscience: Berhanu Negga (m) 

 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International welcomed the ruling on 19 July by a High Court judge that Dr Berhanu Negga, aged 50, be transferred to a less crowded, cleaner and better ventilated cell in Addis Ababa's Kaliti prison, in compliance with the recommendations issued by doctors at the hospital where he was treated in June. However, reports suggest that the judge's orders were not carried out and that he remains in his original cell. Concern remains that his health will further deteriorate if he is not moved to a better cell and allowed to receive adequate medical treatment.
