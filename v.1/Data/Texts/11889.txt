 Japan: Medical concern / ill-treatment: Saied Pilhvar | Amnesty International 
 The life of Saeid Pilhvar, an Iranian detainee in Fuchu Detention Centre near Tokyo, is reported to be in grave danger as a result of ill-treatment and lack of adequate medical attention. Saeid went on hunger-strike after he was interrogated for breaching prison rules by having a ""private conversation"" with an inmate at Kurobane Prison. Subsequently he was forcibly fed by an intravenous drip inserted in his leg. As a result he became unable to walk. He was later transferred to Fuchu Detention Centre where he resumed his hunger-strike and was again force-fed. He is at risk of dying if not given specialist treatment in a civilian hospital.
