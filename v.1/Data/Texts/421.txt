 Cameroon: Further information on prisoner of conscience / fear of further POCs and new health concern: Pius Njawe | Amnesty International 
 Pius Njawe, editor-in-chief of the newspaper Le Messager, imprisoned since 29 October 1996, is being denied access to his doctor and the medical treatment he requires. He suffers from diabetes and a swelling (oedema) of his right calf. Amnesty International is concerned about his health as conditions of detention are harsh in the Central Prison of New Bell, in Douala.
