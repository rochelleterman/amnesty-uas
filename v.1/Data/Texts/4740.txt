 Colombia: Fear for safety/Abduction | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the safety of Ofidia Sànchez and Eulises Trejo who were abducted on 30 March. They were abducted in separate incidents by gunmen thought to be army-backed paramilitaries operating in the region. Their whereabouts are unknown and concern for their safety is heightened by the discovery of the body of Gilma Rosa Graciano, who was abducted at the same time as Ofidia Sànchez.
