 Guatemala: fear for safety: Julio Morales Reyes, community activist, and other workers at the Coordinadora Cakchiquel de Desarrollo Integral (COCADI) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Julio Morales Reyes, a community activist particularly known for his work with COCADI, which promotes development projects amongst the Cakchiquel and other indigenous communities in Chimaltenango department, is recovering in hospital after an attempt on his life. He was shot by two men on 28 February 1995. He has been threatened several times in the past because of his work. On 2 February 1995, two other COCADI activists were beaten up. This pattern of attacks heightens fears for the safety of Julio Morales Reyes and his co-workers at COCADI."
