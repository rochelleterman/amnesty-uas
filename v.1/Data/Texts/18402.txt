"Saudi Arabia: Preventive Death Penalty Action 
 Saudi Arabia: Preventive Death Penalty Action | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned at the increased use   of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia in recent months.    The killing of Farhan Bin Yahya Bin Hasan Mashikhi on 9   November 1999 brings the number of people put to death    this year to 101. The organization fears that dozens more are also at risk.
