 On 12 June 1994 Adler Giovanni Wilson was killed and Isidro Alberto Pena Tecun seriously injured in an attack by seven men in civilian dress believed to have links with the security forces. Adler Giovanni Wilson was the son of Sonia Victoria Wilson, Secretary General of the Union of Workers of Maintenance and other Sections of the Ministry of Public Finance. According to reports her family and members of the Executive Committee of the union were placed under surveillance and received telephoned death threats in February 1994. Two union members were arbitrarily arrested during a strike held in March 1994. An attempt to arrest Sonia Victoria Wilson was prevented by the intervention of other workers. There is now concern for the safety of all those named above."
