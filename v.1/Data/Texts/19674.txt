 Idris Yousef Abdelrahman, a civil affairs officer for the joint United Nations African Mission in Darfur (UNAMID), is being detained and is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. On 12 July 2011 he was charged with offences that are punishable by death under Sudanese law. Amnesty International fears that the charges may be politically motivated. "
