 NA 
 Ibrahim Bahattin Karakutuk, foreign affairs correspondent of the Kurdish-owned newspaper Ozgur Ulke, has not been seen since he left the newspaper's offices in Ankara at 1pm on 29 November 1994. It is feared that he may have been abducted and could be extrajudicially executed. He had told colleagues recently that he was being followed. The Anti-Terror Branch of Ankara Police Headquarters have denied holding him. There is extreme concern for his safety."
