 UA 396/94 - Guatemala: possible extrajudicial execution / fear for safety: Manuel Lopez, an other returned refugees | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Concern for the safety of returned refugees in Guatemala has been heightened by the killing of Manuel Lopez, recently returned from exile in Mexico. He was found dead near the temporary settlement ""Centro Veracruz"", El Quiche, on 27 October 1994. His hands were tied and the body reportedly bore signs of ill-treatment. There have been many reports of threats, attacks and other acts of intimidation against returning refugees, apparently by members of the army and civilian militias."
