 NA 
 Valery Vasilyevich Parshin is facing imminent execution in Kresty prison in St Petersburg, after his appeal for clemency was turned down by President Yeltsin on 22 March 1995. According to an unofficial source, he also turned down at least five other clemency appeals recently. Valery Parshin was sentenced by the Criminal Cases Collegium of Leningrad Regional Court on 1 August 1991 after being convicted of murder. The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld his sentence on 25 February 1992. Although Valery Parshin was declared sane at the time of his trial, his lawyer claims that he is mentally unstable."
