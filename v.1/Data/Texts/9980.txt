 A US federal judge has issued a landmark order resulting in the suspension of military commission proceedings at Guant‡namo Bay. On 8 November 2004, pre-trial proceedings were underway in the case of Yemeni detainee Salim Ahmed Hamdan when a soldier entered the commission room and handed a piece of paper to the commission's presiding officer. The latter immediately called a recess. Shortly afterwards, the panel came back into the commission room and announced that the proceedings were in indefinite recess.
