 Syria:  A culture oppressed - the torture and imprisonment of Syrian Kurds | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There have been no official investigations into violent events in March 2004, in which at least 30 Kurds were     killed, over two thousand arrested, and many reportedly   tortured.  Syrian Kurds suffer from identity-based        discrimination, including severe restrictions on Kurdish  language and culture."
