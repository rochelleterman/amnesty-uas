 As a result of a request from Luis Ernesto Ascanio's family, officials from the Special Investigations Bureau of the Procurator General's office, in coordination with the Military Penal Court, oversaw on 21 and 22 May 1993 the exhumation of 15 bodies from the central cemetery in Ocana, Norte de Santander department. Relatives of 15-year-old Luis Ernesto Ascanio were able to positively identify his body. Another body was believed to be that of Ramon Villegas, not seen since 12 January 1993, when he was detained with three others Wilson Quintero, Gustavo Coronel and Luis Alfonso Ascanio, whose bodies were handed over to the Special Investigations Bureau by members of the Mobile Brigade no 2. Their detention had initially been denied by the military. "
