 Harassment of the Ntuli family and of other local families perceived as ANC supporters has continued since the funerals of Grace Ntuli and Thulani Mbatha on 29 and 30 January 1995. This action gives information about incidents on 10 February, 19 February and 25 February. In the 25 February incident, about 250 armed police and soldiers raided the Ntuli home, assaulting some of the occupants. JJ Ntuli and his brother Bongani were taken into custody. While in custody they were reportedly denied access to medical treatment for injuries sustained in the assault. The detainees were granted bail on 27 February but were remanded in custody as they were unable to pay. Police have displayed an ""arms cache"" allegedly found at the Ntuli home. Several days after the raid, Bheki Ntuli, who was not present during the raid, received telephoned threats."
