"Mexico: Fear for safety/Paramilitary attacks 
 Mexico: Fear for safety/Paramilitary attacks | Amnesty International 
 In the run up to state elections, communities not         supporting the government are being attacked by  a        paramilitary group reported to be affiliated to the       ruling party. Amnesty International is deeply             concerned that these communities will face further        attacks during and  after the  elections.
