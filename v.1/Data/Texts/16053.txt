 Kyrgyzstan: Further information on fear of forcible return/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 On 9 August, the authorities in Kyrgyzstan extradited four refugees (Zhakhongir Maksudov, Odilzhon Rakhimov, Yakub Toshboev and Rasulzhon Pirmatov) and one asylum-seeker (Faez Tadzhikhalilov) to Uzbekistan, in contravention of their international obligations. Amnesty International is gravely concerned that the five men are now at imminent risk of serious human rights violations, including incommunicado detention, torture and other ill-treatment, a flagrantly unfair trial followed by either long prison sentences or even the death penalty.
