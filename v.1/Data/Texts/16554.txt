 The health of Shaikh 'Abd al-Amir Mansur al-Jamri is reported to have deteriorated. He suffers from a heart disease and has reportedly been transferred to Bahrain's Military Hospital on three occasions since his arrest on 15 April 1995. He is believed to be held in solitary confinement at a detention facility in Safira. To date he has not been charged or brought before a court. On 9 May one of his daughters, 'Afaf 'Abd al-Amir al-Jamri, was brought to al-Qal'a Prison in Al-Manama, to see him. During her meeting she was reportedly beaten by women police officers. She was then arrested and her current whereabouts are unknown."
