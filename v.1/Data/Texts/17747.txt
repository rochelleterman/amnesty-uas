 Israel/Occupied Territories: Fear of torture / legal concern / arbitrary arrests | Amnesty International 
 Around 60 Lebanese nationals have been arrested by the South Lebanese Army (SLA) in Israeli-occupied South Lebanon following a roadside bomb explosion near the village of Markaba on 27 May 1998.  They are now said to be under interrogation by the SLA and Israel's General Security Service (GSS). There are grave fears that those arrested are in danger of being tortured, ill-treated or detained for prolonged periods without trial.
