 Twelve soldiers, including Amara Conteh, have been executed by firing squad on 11 and 12 November 1994. All had been tried by a court martial, although details of the trials and convictions are not known. They do not appear to have had any right of appeal. The latest executions have been described as a crackdown on indiscipline in the army. A further six soldiers are on trial before a court martial on charges of murder, and there are fears that further executions of soldiers convicted and sentenced to death by courts martial may take place."
