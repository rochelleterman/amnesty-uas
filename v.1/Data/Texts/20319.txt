 The inhabitants of San Antonio Ebul√°, outside the state capital of Campeche, were forcibly evicted and some were beaten on 13 August by private security guards aided by police. The village was razed to the ground, but the inhabitants are planning to return peacefully. Violence may be used by police and private security guards to prevent their return."
