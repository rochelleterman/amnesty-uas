 Iran: Fear of ""disappearance""/fear for safety/health concern/possible prisoner of conscience: Saleh Kamrani (m), lawyer and human rights defender
 | Amnesty International 
 Azeri Turkish lawyer Saleh Kamrani, aged about 34, is feared to have been abducted by the security forces on 14 June, and to be in unacknowledged detention where he would be at risk of torture. He reportedly needs medication for a heart condition. He may be held solely for his work as a lawyer and human rights defender, in which case Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience.
