 Turkey: Fear for safety/fear of arrest of human rights defenders | Amnesty International 
 A longstanding human rights defender, Nimet Tanr kulu, and three leading politicians, Erdal Karahanl, Sabahattin U ra, and Sinan Tutan, have been detained for protesting against recent prison raids which led to the death of at least 30 prisoners. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience and is concerned for their safety. The organization also fears that others may be detained solely for expressing their views as the Turkish authorities step up their campaign against human rights defenders.
