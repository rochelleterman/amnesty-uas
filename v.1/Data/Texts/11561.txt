 The Indonesian Government has permitted representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit Xanana Gusmao at an unspecified location in Jakarta on 7 December 1992. He had been in incommunicado detention for 17 days before the visit. At least 39 others, including relatives and friends of Xanana Gusmao, are still in incommunicado detention and have yet to be visited by the ICRC. One of the detainees, Jorge Manuel Araujo Serrano, is reported to have died under torture and two women have reportedly been raped in detention. "
