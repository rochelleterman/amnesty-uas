 The Presidential Adviser on Human Rights has informed AI that the death threats against those named above are being investigated and that measures are being taken to protect their lives. Also, administrative and penal investigations have been opened into allegations that members of the armed forces, acting with paramilitary groups, are reponsible for threats against and intimidation of civilians in the Magdalena Medio region. AI welcomes these investigations but remains concerned because the majority of such investigations fail to lead to the prosecution and conviction of those responsible for violations. "
