 Peru: Further information on arbitrary detention / fear of torture and new concerns: ill-treatment / death threats | Amnesty International 
 Susana Roque Castro (f), aged 34, Rosa Cardenas R (f), aged 46: There is concern at reports that the above women were ill-treated and threatened with being killed when they were arbitrarily detained on 25 April 1997. According to reports the taxi they were travelling in was intercepted by two armed men dressed as civilians. The women were forced out of the taxi and into the other car and there they were ill-treated and threatened. They were then driven to Condevilla Police Station where they remained for several hours, before being transferred to the DINCOTE.
