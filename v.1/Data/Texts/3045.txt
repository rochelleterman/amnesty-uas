 Tanzania / Burundi / Rwanda: refoulement / fear of extrajudicial execution | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about reports that Burundi and Rwandese asylum-seekers and refugees are being returned forcibly to Burundi by the Tanzanian security forces. There are credible reports that some of the returned refugees have been killed by the Burundi army within minutes of their return. AI acknowledges that the approximately 600 000 Rwandese and 88 000 Burundi refugees that Tanzania is host to are putting a great strain on the country, for which it has received insufficient help from the international community. However, AI believes that this does not excuse the government's failure to respect the right to asylum."
