 Ulaanshuvu, a former lecturer at Inner Mongolia University, has been detained since 31 July 1991. He is reportedly in poor health, suffering from recurrent kidney trouble, a heart complaint and other ailments for which he has not received any medical attention. His prison conditions are also described as poor. It is believed that Ulaanshuvu, who is a prisoner of conscience, has been ill-treated both in police custody prior to sentencing and in Yikezhao Meng No 5 Prison, where he is currently detained."
