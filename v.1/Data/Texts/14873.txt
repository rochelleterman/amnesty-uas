 There is concern for the safety of two correspondents of the Kurdish owned daily newspaper Ozgur Gundem. Tacettin Demir is said to have been detained on 13 July 1993 after investigating an incident in Diyadin on 12 July when security forces and guerrillas of the PKK (Kurdish Workers' Party) clashed. He has been held in unacknowledged detention since 13 July and it is feared he is being tortured in incommunicado detention. Nezahat Ozmen had been researching the case of a young girl, Sukran Aydin, who was tortured and raped by a police officer after being detained on 20 June 1993 at the gendarmerie station in Derik, Mardin province. On 16 July, Nezahat Ozmen was herself detained and on 19 July was transferred to hospital having being severely tortured. She is seven months' pregnant."
