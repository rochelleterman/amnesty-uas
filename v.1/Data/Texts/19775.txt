 At least 40 Muslim clerics and scholars were arrested by soldiers on 13 and 14 August 2008 in the capital, Asmara and the towns of Senafe, Adi Keyh, Tsorona, Segeneiti, Dekemhare, Foro, Hadish, and Idafalo in the coastal Red Sea region. They were arrested in the middle of the night and taken away in unmarked cars. They are held incommunicado in undisclosed locations, which puts them in danger of torture."
