 There are growing fears for the safety of the above, a 23-year-old woman and indigenous rights activist, who is reported to have been forcibly detained by security personnel from her home in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh on 12 June 1996 and whose whereabouts remain unknown. She and two of her brothers were forcibly taken from their home, blindfolded and with their hands tied. At some distance from the house the brothers managed to escape despite being shot at by the security personnel.
