 Syria: Further information on: Prisoners of conscience/incommunicado detention/fear of torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Muhammad Ra'dun's health is reported to have deteriorated severely since he was detained in May. He reportedly suffers from a chronic inflammation of the windpipe which can cause him to choke in his sleep; the prison authorities have apparently refused to allow him a cellmate. Nizar Ristnawi has reportedly been transferred to Sednaya Prison, on the outskirts of Damascus. He has been detained incommunicado since he was arrested, in April. Amnesty International considers both men to be prisoners of conscience, held solely for carrying out their peaceful and legitimate work in defence of human rights.
