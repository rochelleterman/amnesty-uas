 All of the above-named detainees were released on 2 September 1992 by Ankara State Security Court. They have all reported that they were tortured in police custody. Methods used included hanging by the wrists or arms, electric shocks, and falaka (beating on the soles of the feet). Fatma Cicek is reportedly suffering from a foot infection accompanied by inflammation and purulent secretions, resulting from falaka. No details are yet available concerning whether or not they will be charged with any offence. "
