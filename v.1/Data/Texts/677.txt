 On 24 April 1995 a military court sentenced Pedro Masa Mba and retired Lieutenant-Colonel Pedro Esono Masie to 30 and 12 years respectively. A co-defendant was acquitted and others were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 9 to 28 years. No death sentences were passed by the court. Reportedly, all but one of the defendants showed signs of severe torture and testified in court that they had been tortured. There is also concern that their trial was unfair and that the defendants were given no right of appeal against their conviction or sentence."
