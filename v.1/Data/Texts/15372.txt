 UA 434/94 - Turkey: possible ""disappearance"" / fear of extrajudicial execution: Ayhan Uzala | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is grave concern for the safety of Ayhan Uzala who ""disappeared"" on 29 November 1994. On 2 December 1994 his parent reportedly received an anonymous telephone call saying that their son was held at the Anti-Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters. However his parents have not received any information from the authorities on his whereabouts. Ayhan Uzala was convicted of membership of the illegal Turkish Communist Party/Marxist-Leninist (TKP/ML) and had been detained several times. Most recently he was charged with membership of the TKP/ML on 6 May 1993 but was acquitted in January 1994."
