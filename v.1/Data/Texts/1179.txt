 UA 425/94 - Kenya: health concern: Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki is currently in Nakuru prison on charges, possibly fabricated, of robbery with violence and possession of firearms. AI is extremely concerned about his health as he has not yet received treatment for serious head injuries reportedly sustained during torture in incommunicado detention in July 1994. He was given a CT scan on 14 October, 3 months after sustaining the injuries, which diagnosed subdural haematoma. A second opinion was requested, which has still not been received. Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki has not received any treatment."
