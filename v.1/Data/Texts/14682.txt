 Ismail Agaya, Mehmet Asin and Mansur Daslik have ""disappeared"" in detention after their arrests in late May/early June 1994. The authorities have denied their arrest although their detentions were witnessed. The detention of two others, Zafer Tuzun and Mehmet Kurt, has been acknowledged, but there are fears they are being subjected to torture. All of those arrested bar Mehmet Kurt are distributors of the pro-Kurdish newspaper Ozgur Ulke (Free Country)."
