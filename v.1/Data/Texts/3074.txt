 UA 17/93 - Togo: extrajudicial executions: 16 people in a peaceful demonstration in Lome | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 At least 16 demonstrators and possibly as many as 24 were killed during a peaceful demonstration in Lome on 25 January 1993. The demonstration had been organized to show opposition support for an initiative by the French and German Governments to try to resolve the deadlock between the President, the transitional government and the transitional parlimentary body. The security forces apparently ordered the demonstrators to move to a nearby square and then opened fire without warning. An official statement said that 12 people had been killed, including a police officer, and that the security forces had fired in the air after one of their members had been attacked. However, this version of events is disputed by eye- witnesses. "
