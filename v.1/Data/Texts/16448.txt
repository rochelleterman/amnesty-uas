 The 14 ethnic Albanians named above, and possibly two others, were arrested between 27 July and 3 August 1993 in various parts of Kosovo province, and are now reportedly detained in police stations in Pristina on suspicion of membership of illegal organizations. There is concern at reports that some or all of the men have been severely beaten in detention. Most of the detained are aged between 21 and 30 years, although one man, Ahmet Axhiu, is aged about 60. He is reported to have attempted suicide after being beaten and has reportedly been transferred to hospital. It is also reported that the men's families have been denied access to them."
