 AI has received further reports that Russian troops have deliberately killed civilians, including two seven-year-old children, in the continuing conflict in the Chechen Republic-Ichkeriya. People fleeing the town of Samashki claim that Russian troops burned down houses and threw grenades into basements where people were taking cover. Journalists have been denied access to the town but an ICRC official who was allowed to spend a few hours in Samashki reported seeing many bodies in the streets. Residents claim that 200 people were killed in the assault."
