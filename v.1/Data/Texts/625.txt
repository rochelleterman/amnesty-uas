 The six men named above are among dozens of unarmed civilians who were shot dead by the security forces in early September 1993 in Tadjourah district. Members of the Afar ethnic group have repeatedly been the victims of gross human rights violations, including rape, torture and extrajudicial execution, often as a result of reprisals for losses inflicted by the Front pour la restauration de l'unite de la democracie (FRUD), who have been fighting the government since 1991. Troops recently rounded up hundreds of Afar men, killing some who resisted and detaining others in military camps, particularly in Randa and Assagueila, where there are reports of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, including beatings and denial of food. Thousands of Afars have fled to Ethiopia. "
