 Five legislators have asked the Philippine House of Representatives to conduct an investigation into the case of missing Indigenous rights activist James Balao, saying the government and military have failed to uphold international human rights standards. In earlier media interviews, one of the five members of Congress said that the previous efforts to seek the help of the military in finding the activist had produced no results, prompting them to take action."
