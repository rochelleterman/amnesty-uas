 Mirzo Salimov, an opposition journalist, has ""disappeared"". He was arrested on 1 May 1995 at a market in Gissar by people in uniforms who forced him at gunpoint into a car. Unofficial sources allege that Mirzo Salimov is in the custody of officials of the Ministry of Security in Dushanbe. From early 1993 Mirzo Salimov lived in exile in Russia where he was a correspondent for the opposition newspaper Charogi Ruz (Light of Day). He returned to Tajikistan about six months before his ""disappearance""."
