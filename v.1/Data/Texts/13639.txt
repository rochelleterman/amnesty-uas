 Thailand: health concern: Maung Kyan, Mon refugee, early 30s | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is gravely concerned that Maung Kyan, an ethnic Mon refugee from Myanmar currently held as an ""illegal immigrant"" in the Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) in Bangkok, may not be receiving urgently needed medical care. Maung Kyan lost both arms and eyes in a landmine explosion over 10 years ago. In October 1995 he had a cornea transplant which allows him limited sight in one eye. Since then he has needed monitoring and anti-rejection medication. AI is calling for him and his family to be transferred out of the IDC as a matter of urgency and for him to get the treatment he needs."
