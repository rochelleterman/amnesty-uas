 A temporary migrants’ canteen in Huehuetoca, Mexico State, has been shot at by unknown men. This follows the closure of a migrants’ shelter in Lechería by volunteers who worked there due to the violence and threats against them. The lives of migrants and the human rights defenders that work with them in Mexico State are at grave risk. "
