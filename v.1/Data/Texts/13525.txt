 A response has been received to UA 121/95 in the form of a statement by the International Secretariat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). This sets out their observations on UA 121/95 which called for the immediate halt to the deliberate and arbitrary killing of non-combatant civilians, following the killing of at least 42 Sinhalese civilians at Kallarawa in the east of Sri Lanka on 26 May. On 8 September AI issued a substantive reply addressing these observations and reiterating AI's concerns about the killings at Kallarawa."
