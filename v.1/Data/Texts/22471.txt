 Israel/Egypt: Fear for Safety | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Since 23 August, the Israeli army has been sending scores of asylum-seekers and migrants, originating from countries such as Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia, back to Egypt without providing them with an opportunity to challenge the decision to expel them. Asylum-seekers and migrants who are forcibly returned from Israel to Egypt are in danger of being detained incommunicado and then being forcibly returned to countries such as Eritrea and Sudan where they are at risk of further human rights violations.
