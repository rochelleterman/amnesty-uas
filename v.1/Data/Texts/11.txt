 On 30 September 1996, soldiers of the Rwandese Patriotic Army forcibly expelled 392 Burundi refugees from Rwanda to Burundi's northwestern province of Cibitoke, an area characterized by a high level of killings by the Burundi security forces and armed opposition groups. Over 3,000 others are also threatened with refoulement from Rwanda. Rwandese government officials have reportedly described the returns as voluntary.
