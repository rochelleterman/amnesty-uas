 UA 145/93 - Guatemala: Possible extrajudicial execution: Tomas Lares Cipriano | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned at the apparent extrajudicial execution on 30 April 1993 of Tomas Lares Cipriano, a member of Consejo de Comunidades Etnicas ""Runujel Junam"" (CERJ), Council of Ethnic Communities ""We are all equal"", and of the Committee for Peasant Unity, Comite de Unidad Campesina (CUC). There are fears that other members of CERJ may be in renewed danger of human rights abuses. "
