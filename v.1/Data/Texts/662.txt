 Norberto Mba Nze, a representative of the Convergencia para la Democracia Social (CPDS), Convergence for Social Democracy, was apparently arrested on 28 February 1994 by the government representative in Akonibe, after he had made comments about the behaviour of this representative to the provincial governor. Since then he has been held incommunicado at Akonibe police station, where he has reportedly been severely tortured. He has reportedly sustained damage to the kidneys and has several open wounds, but has been denied medical treatment. He has been briefly detained on previous occasions for his peaceful political activities."
