 Mohamed Hedi Sassi was sentenced on 19 May to four years and one month's imprisonment on charges including membership of an unauthorized organization (the Parti communiste des ouvriers tunisiens, PCOT). He is a prisoner of conscience. Despite requests from his lawyers and family, there has been no public investigation carried out into allegations that he was tortured during incommunicado detention, after which he is said to have suffered some loss of hearing."
