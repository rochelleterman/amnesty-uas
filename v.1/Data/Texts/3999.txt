 Information now available has partially clarified reports of the massacre of Yanomami Indians from the village of Haximu, on the Brazilian/Venezuelan border. According to survivors the Haximu community has been the target of attacks by Brazilian gold prospectors (garimpeiros) since early July 1993. In the latest attack on 22 or 23 July garimpeiros shot two women and an old man dead, kicked another woman to death, and killed six children and three adolescent girls with machete blows. When the remaining villagers fled, the garimpeiros apparently burned down two and possibly three communal huts (malocas). Survivors interviewed at the Makos village have provided 23 nick-names of garimpeiros they allege to have been responsible. "
