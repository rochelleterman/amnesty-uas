 Syria / Iran: Forcible return/ Fear of torture and ill-treatment/ death sentence | Amnesty International 
 Six Iranian Arab men (Ali Bouazar, Kamal        Nawaseri, Afnan Yousuf Azizi Bani Toruf, Salahuddin       Hilali    Majd Sawari, Ahmad Assadi, Jaber Obeyat), were            arrested in the Syrian capital Damascus on 5 March. It is believed that two of them, Ali Bouazar, who reportedly faces a death sentence in Iran, and Kamal Nawaseri, may have been forcibly returned to Iran on the day of their arrest. The remaining four men are reportedly held incommunicado at an unknown location, where they are at risk of torture and of being forcibly returned to Iran.
