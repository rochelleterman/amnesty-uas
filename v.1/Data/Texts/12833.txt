 On 5 April 1994 in Lahore, Manzoor Masih, a Christian was shot death and three other Christians, Rehmat Masih, Salamat Masih, aged 13, and John Joseph were seriously injured. Their attackers were three gunmen whom eyewitnesses have named as Imam Bux, Mohammad Akram and Malik Sadiq, members of the Islamist party, Sepah-e Sahaba. The first three men named above had been charged with blasphemy by leaders of the Sepah-e Sahaba. As of 6 April, none of the accused had been arrested or questioned by the police."
