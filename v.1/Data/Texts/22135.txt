 NA 
 The execution of juvenile offender, Behnoud Shojaee, which was scheduled to take place on 7 May 2008, has been stayed for a month on order of the Head of the Judiciary. This is to allow Behnoud Shojaee to seek a pardon from the family of the boy he was convicted of fatally stabbing on 18 June 2005, and to allow the two families to reach a financial settlement.  Should an agreement not be made, Behnoud Shojaee remains at risk of being executed. "
