 AI is gravely concerned about reported killings, executions and detentions in Juba in June, July and August 1992. Reports have been received of the execution of Andrew Tombe, a Sudanese employee of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). He had been convicted of treason by a military tribunal. Reports suggest that Aboudwan Talle, another USAID employee, has also been executed. Mark Laboke Jenner, a clerk at the Juba sub-office of the European Commission, was reportedly arrested in August 1992. "
