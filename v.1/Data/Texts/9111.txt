 Further information has been received regarding the stay of execution granted to Gary Graham. In a 5-4 ruling on 2 June, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted the stay, just hours before the execution was scheduled to take place. It was granted pending a decision by the US Supreme Court in another Texas case, Johnson v Texas, in an appeal which claims that Dorsie Johnson, a 19 year old offender on death row, was sentenced unconstitutionally, since his youth was not taken into consideration as a mitigating circumstance.
