 Maryam Rostampour and Marzieh Amirizadeh Esmaeilabad, members of the Christian community in Iran, were arrested on 5 March 2009. In a telephone call Marzieh Amirizadeh Esmaeilabad said that they are both suffering from an infection and have not received adequate medical attention. They remain detained without charge in an overcrowded cell with 27 other women. Maryam Rostampour and Marzieh Amirizadeh Esmaeilabad may be prisoners of conscience, detained solely on account of their religious beliefs. Amnesty International is concerned for the women's health."
