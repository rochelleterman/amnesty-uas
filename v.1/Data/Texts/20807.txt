 Myanmar: Health concern/torture and other ill-treatment: U Win Tin (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 U Win Tin, the longest-serving prisoner of conscience in Myanmar, needs urgent medical attention. He has recently been suffering from severe asthma attacks and lung problems. He also has heart disease and spondylitis (inflammation of the joints of the spine). He is allowed to see a doctor regularly, who prescribes him medicine, but this is inadequate, and he has not received the medical treatment he desperately needs from the authorities in Yangonâ€™s Insein Prison, where he has been in solitary confinement for much of the past 19 years.
