 Ecuador: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Marça Teresa Cherres Mesças, a community leader from Condor village in Orellana province, in the northern Amazon region of Ecuador, has been threatened and intimidated. The threats appear to be linked to her criticism of an oil company operating in the region, and her defence of the labour rights of oil company workers and of the communities in Orellana where the company operates. Her life and the lives of other community leaders may be in danger.
