 The 13 Kurdish villagers named are reportedly being held incommunicado by the security forces at an unknown location. They were detained on 13 January. Gendarmerie soldiers reportedly stripped a woman from the village of Payamli in southeast Turkey naked on 10 January, which provoked one of the villagers to shoot at the soldiers, wounding two. Reinforcement forces were called and on arrival they set fire to many ouses and took away the above-named people. AI is concerned for their safety. Villagers from Payamli came into conflict with the security forces in 1991 when they refused to join the village guard system."
