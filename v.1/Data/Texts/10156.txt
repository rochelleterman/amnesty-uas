 Venezuela: Fear of torture / fear of further arbitrary arrests | Amnesty International 
 Wilma Rauseo (f), trade unionist, and other trade union activists: On 23 April 1997 Wilma Rauseo was arbitrarily arrested by members of the Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services (DISIP), at her work place in Caracas, reportedly in relation to her trade union activism and her membership in the Movimiento Bolivariano Revolucionario 200 (MBR-200). She was held incommunicado for four days before her family were allowed to visit her. She has still not been charged with any offence. There are fears that she may be tortured while in detention. There is also concern that other trade union activists may be arbitrarily detained in the run up to 1 May, when an independent labour day march is planned.
