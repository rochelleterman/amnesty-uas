 The five people named above were arrested on 15 and 16 December in Addis Ababa after returning from exile to represent their respective political organizations at a conference of peace and reconciliation to be held on 18-23 December. The main reason for the arrests appears to prevent prominent political opponents from receiving public exposure and possible support in a political conference inside Ethiopia. They are held in the police Central Investigation Bureau in Addis Ababa; they have not been charged with any offence. The government has said that Ibsa Gutama is held in connection with the OLF's armed struggle."
