 Troy Kunkle has received a new execution date of 25 January. He was convicted in 1985 of the murder of Stephen Horton in 1984. In December 2004, a US Supreme Court Justice said that Troy Kunkle's death sentence was imposed in violation of the US Constitution, but that the Court was procedurally barred by a technical issue of state versus federal law from remedying that violation.
