 Valentin Besleag, aged 59, from Corjova village in the Dubasari region of the self-proclaimed Dnestr Moldavian Republic (DMR), has been detained at the police station in Dubasari since 2 June. He and his family have not been informed of the reasons for his arrest; nor have they been allowed to see the court order for his detention. His family has not been allowed to pass on necessary medication to him via the prison authorities. He may be being detained for legitimately exercising his right to freedom of expression, and thus may be a prisoner of conscience.
