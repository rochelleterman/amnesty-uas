 Turkey: Fear of ""disappearance"" / fear of torture: Mehmet Yamac | Amnesty International 
 Mehmet Yamac, a 33-year-old Kurd, was brought to his sister's home in Adana by police officers who searched the house and reportedly took US $700. He was unable to walk. The police took him and his sister with them to the Security Headquarters leaving the woman at the door. The family has been told, however, that he is not being held in detention by the police. He has previously been detained in connection with a Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) trial.
