 UA 312/93 - Sudan: fear of torture / legal concern: El-Fadil Adam | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 El-Fadil Adam, a member of the banned Umma Party, was arrested in late August 1993 in Khartoum, apparently on suspicion of producing and distributing leaflets critical of the government. His arrest seems to be part of a widespread crackdown on opposition groups, with a number of arrests of members of the Umma Party, and of the three major religious orders of the traditional Sudanese Islam, the Ansar, the Khatmiya and the Ansar Sunna. His place of detention is unknown, and he is at grave risk of being subjected to torture in incommunicado detention. He is considered a prisoner of conscience."
