 According to unofficial sources in China, Liu Gang, the 31-year-old former student leader, is in very poor health due to continuous ill-treatment and harsh conditions of detention. The latest news, dating from late April 1993, includes an account by Liu Gang himself, dated January 1993, which is reported to have been recently smuggled out of prison. His account confirms previous reports from other sources about the torture and ill-treatment suffered by Liu Gang and other political prisoners at the Lingyuan No 2 Labour-Reform Detachment in Liaoning province, as well as giving new information about his treatment in recent months.
