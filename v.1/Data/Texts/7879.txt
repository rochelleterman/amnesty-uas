 NA 
 There is grave concern at the reported ""disappearance"" of Hugo Zapata Gutierrez, a teacher from Villac in the district of Ulcumayo, Junin province, department of Junin. He was last seen on 15 December 1993 in the presence of three men, after being allegedly requested to present himself at the Ulcumayo Counter-Insurgency Military Base. The three men are alleged to have been members of the local civil defence. Despite inquiries by his relatives and the provincial prosecutor the army have denied his detention, and his whereabouts remain unknown."
