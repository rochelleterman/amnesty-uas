 There is concern for the safety of the three trade unionists named above from the Central Generale des Travailleurs (CGT), General Workers' Union, who were reportedly arrested and severely beaten by uniformed members of the police belonging to the 30th Company, on 23 April 1993, as they were on their way to deliver a press release in support of a general strike. Cajuste Lexius was reported to have been unconscious for two days as a result of the beatings that he received. All three men remain in custody and have not appeared before a judge. "
