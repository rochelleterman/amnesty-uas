 NA 
 Two former government ministers under Saddam Hussain and his former private secretary were sentenced to death on 26 October and could be executed within 30 days if their sentences are confirmed by the appeal court.  Amnesty International has stressed that the death penalty is the ultimate denial of human rights and should never be used, whatever the gravity of the crime."
