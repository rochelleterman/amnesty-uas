 Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories/Egypt: UA 11/08 - Medical concern | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Israeli authorities are refusing to allow critically ill Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip for urgent medical treatment which is not available in Gaza. Since Israel tightened its blockade on the Gaza Strip in June 2007, closing the crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, every one of the 1.5 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip requires permission to leave from the Israeli military authorities. This is almost always refused."
