 On 31 March the four journalists named above, who are facing subversion charges, were all released on bail. The case is due to be mentioned in court on 14 April 1994. There is concern at the use of the legal process by the Government to apparently intimidate and harss the independent press in Kenya. Several other journalists have been arrested in recent weeks for attempting to investigate and report incidents of political violence."
