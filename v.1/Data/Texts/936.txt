 Gambia: Further information on death penalty | Amnesty International 
 Souleyman Sarr, Mballo Kanteh, Essa Baldeh and Omar Dampha: On 25 June 1997 the above-named men were sentenced to death after being found guilty of treason for trying to overthrow the government. In July, the prisoners appealed against their conviction and on 2 October, the court of appeal quashed the convictions and sentences. The ruling suggested that a new trial should start and that the killing of soldiers should be qualified as murder. Although the immediate threat of execution is banned, there is still a risk that the four men may be sentenced to death.
