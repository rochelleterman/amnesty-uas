 Colombia: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 A bodyguard employed through a government protection program to protect the head of the human rights organization Reiniciar has been shot and killed, and other staff of the organisation are believed to be in danger. The man killed was the son of an activist for a left-wing political party, and its members may also be targets. The gunmen are thought to be members of a paramilitary organization. Bodyguard Higinio Baquero Mahecha had been assigned to Reiniciar executive director Jahel Quiroga Carrillo, as part of the protection measures the government provided to the organisation at the request of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).
