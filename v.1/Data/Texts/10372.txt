 UA 364/93 - Bangladesh: death threats: Taslima Nasrin | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern that the Government of Bangladesh is failing to provide protection for Taslima Nasrin, a Muslim woman novelist accused of blasphemy and condemned to death on 1 October 1993 by an Islamist group in Bangladesh. The group, the ""Council of Soldiers of Islam"", has called for her death for writing a novel about the situation of a Hindu family in Bangladesh. The Government of Bangladesh has banned the book. After a previous death threat against her in September by the same group, the authorities apparently failed to respond to her appeal for protection. "
