The Sixth Circuit panel took the unusual step of granting him an ""en banc"" hearing in front of the full court (14   members). It has given the defence lawyers until 17       April, and the state until 1 May, to file their briefs    with the court. After that, a date will be set for oral   arguments to be heard."
