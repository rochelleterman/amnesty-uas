 Myanmar: fear of ill-treatment / legal concern: U Tun Shwe, U Thu Wai, U Htwe Myint | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI fears that the three men named above may be facing ill-treatment in detention. They have been sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, apparently after a summary trial. AI is concerned that the three may be prisoners of conscience and that the trial may not have conformed to international standards for fair trial. The three were sentenced after meeting regularly with foreigners. There is concern for their well-being, heightened by the fact that ill-treatment is common in Myanmar's detention centres. Conditions in Insein prison do not meet international standards."
