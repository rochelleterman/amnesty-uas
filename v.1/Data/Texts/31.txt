 Rwanda/Tanzania: Further information on fear of refoulement: more than 500,000 Rwandese refugees in Tanzania | Amnesty International 
 Over 130,000 of the more than 500,000 refugees in Tanzania are now reported to have returned to Rwanda after their forcible expulsion from Tanzania. Hundreds of thousands more are expected to cross the border in the next few days. There remains concern for around 100,000 other refugees who have fled into the countryside, and at the continuing policy of refoulement. Amnesty International is also investigating unconfirmed reports of beatings and ill-treatment of some refugees by the Tanzania security forces.
