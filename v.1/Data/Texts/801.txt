 AI is concerned about further arrests in Addis Ababa in early February 1994, bringing the number of journalists arrested to 18. AI believes that all are prisoners of conscience and should be released immediately and unconditionally. All are apparently held on account of articles critical of the government, which the authorities regard as violating a Press Law issued in October 1992. Some appear to be held illegally. Their conditions of detention are reportedly poor and some are in poor health. Provisional release on bail has been refused."
