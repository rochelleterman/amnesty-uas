 Around 20 detainees held in the Urso Branco prison, Porto Velho, Rondonia state are reportedly in danger of being   killed by other inmates. Most of those in danger are      recently transferred detainees being housed in holding    cells (seguro), which are used for inmates deemed to be   at risk from others. Continued negligence from state      authorities has led to extreme overcrowding, and          prisoners of different categories being held together.
