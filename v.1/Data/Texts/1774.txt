 Zimbabwe: Fear of torture	 | Amnesty International 
 Trade unionists Edward Dzeka and Joyce Muwoni have gone into hiding, after threatening phone calls from the police, who want them to come in for questioning about ""illegal"" trade union activities. Edward Dzeka was arrested by the police in September and reportedly tortured. Amnesty International believes he and Joyce Musoni would be at grave risk of torture if arrested.
