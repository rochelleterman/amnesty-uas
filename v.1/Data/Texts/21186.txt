 Pakistan: The unnecessary detention of children | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Of the approximately 4,500 children in Pakistan's prisons in June 2003 more than 3,000 of them had not been         convicted of any crime. Despite conviction rates as low   as 15-20%, juveniles, some as young as eight years old,   who have been accused of a criminal offence may spend     months or even years in jail waiting for their trial to   begin or to conclude.
