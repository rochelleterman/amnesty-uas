 Shyley Kondowe, John Banda and Robert Khembo, officials of the opposition Malawi Democratic Party (MDP), were brought to court in mid-March 1993 charged with possession of seditious publications. Shyley Kondowe and John Banda were released on bail at the end of March. Robert Khembo, who was released on bail in mid-April, was re-arrested shortly after his release for criticising his imprisonment and the one-party rule of Life-President Dr Kamuzu Banda. No date has been set for their trial. "
