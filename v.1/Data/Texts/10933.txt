 The Xinhua news agency today (27 July 1995) released a video recording of Harry Wo ""confessing"" that the information in two television programs he made with a reporter of the BBC was ""wrong and untrue"". The video reportedly shows Harry Wu, looking tired and unkempt, making his confession in the presence of a Chinese official. AI continues to call for the release of Hongda Harry Wu, whom it believes to be a prisoner of conscience."
