 Three East Timorese university students have reportedly been arrested by Indonesian security forces in Dili, East Timor, for their alleged political activities. Rui ""Los Palos"", a student in Singaraja, Bali, and two others who study at an academy in Jakarta were reportedly arrested by the military on 14 May 1993. Their current whereabouts are unknown, and there is concern that they may be subjected to torture or ill-treatment in incommunicado detention. "
