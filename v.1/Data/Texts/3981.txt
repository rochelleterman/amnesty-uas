 On 15 July appeals were issued for the safety of Sister Zotti and other Franciscan nuns working with indigenous people in Escondido, Mato Grosso, who had been subjected to death threats. In the original action the state where these threats had been occurring was incorrectly given as Mato Grosso do Sul. According to a human rights organization, the ""Marcal de Souza"" Human Rights Defence Centre, in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, which has been in touch with them, the threats against the nuns have stopped. However the situation in the Cotriguacu region of Mato Grosso reportedly remains tense, with continuing conflicts between indigenous groups and local landowners and lumber companies. "
