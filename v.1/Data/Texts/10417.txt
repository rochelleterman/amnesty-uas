 Concern for the safety of Myanmar refugees in Thailand has been heightened by the abduction of two Karen leaders by the DKBO, an armed group suported by Myanmar's ruling military authority, the SLORC. San Tun, a Karen Buddhist leader, was abducted at gunpoint on 1 March 1995 from Mae Ta Wa refugee camp. ""Uncle Jolly"", another Karen leader, was abducted the following night. Several Karen leaders have reportedly been abducted from Mae La Camp in February."
