 Sirin Bayram, Kurdish building labourer, aged 17, Ramazan Tekin (note full name) Kurdish farmer, aged 62: There is still no information on the whereabouts of the above named men since they were detained in Demirli (Temiran) village, Diyarbakir province, on 2 November 1996. However, fears for their safety have been heightened by the recent discovery of the bodies of three Kurdish men taken into custody in Diyarbakir between 29 November and 9 December 1996. On 23 December the bodies of Atilla Korkmaz and Mahmut Onerari were found by a main road near Adiyaman killed by a shot to the head and showing signs of torture. The body of Tevfik Kusun was found near Adiyaman on 7 January 1997.
