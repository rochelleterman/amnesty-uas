 Ethiopia: Further information on  Fear for safety / Use of excessive force by   Security forces | Amnesty International 
 Journalist Seifu Mekonnen was released without charge on 26 April. There is no news on the fate of the members of the Ethiopian Democratic Party (EDP) and the All Amhara People's Organisation (AAPO), who are believed to be held incommunicado, or of the over 100 students still held in custody. All of them were apparently detained following the riots in Addis Ababa on 17 and 18 April. They are feared to be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Please continue to send appeals on their behalf.
