 Uzbekistan: Fear of imminent execution/torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Azamat Uteev, Ilkhom Karimov and Evgeny Gugnin are        believed to be in imminent danger of execution. There are allegations that they were tortured in pre-trial          detention. Their only hope is that the        President   grants them clemency, as he has for several     prisoners whose cases Amnesty International has taken up.
