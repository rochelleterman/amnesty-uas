 United Kingdom: Impunity / legal concern: Augusto Pinochet | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned that if Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former military ruler, is allowed to return to Chile from the UK,  there will be no opportunity for any court of law to determine his guilt or innocence with respect to any of the charges of crimes against humanity brought against him, as listed in the extradition requests from several countries. He would effectively be granted impunity for crimes against humanity.
