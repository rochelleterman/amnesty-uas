 Belarus: Ill-treatment / possible prisoners of conscience: Peaceful demonstrators reportedly beaten, 10 detained | Amnesty International 
 On 17 November 1996, Belarussian police reportedly beat demonstrators with truncheons and arrested more than 10 people during a peaceful demonstration against the President called the ""March of Silence"" in Minsk. As political unrest in Belarus grows, Amnesty International fears that this latest use of force by police against peaceful protestors may be repeated.
