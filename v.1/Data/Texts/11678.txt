 East Timor: Further information on possible arbitrary arrest / fear of torture or ill-treatment: Rui Campus | Amnesty International 
 Rui Campus, a 20-year-old East Timorese student who was arrested in late January, remains in incommunicado detention.  It is thought that he has been transferred to another detention centre in Los Palos following unsuccessful attempts by human rights monitors to make contact with him. AI is concerned that he may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment.
