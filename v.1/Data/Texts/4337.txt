 NA 
 There is concern at the apparent extrajudicial execution of three members of the Enciso family in San Juan de Rio Seco, Cundinamarca department. According to reports, an army platoon went to the farm of Luis Antonio Enciso on 4 January, searching for the kidnapped industrialist Carlos Upegui Zapata. The military had previously visited the farm and threatened the workers there. Luis Antonio, with his 15-year-old daughter, Luis Amelia, accompanied the platoon leader to the local military base in an attempt to stop the harassment. On 5 January, after they failed to return, Manuel Guillermo Enciso, Luis Antonio's father, went with a friend to the military base. The friend was told to go home. On 6 January the bodies of the three were found by local farm workers."
