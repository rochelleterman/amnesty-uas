 Further death threats have been made against Chris Khoza, ANC branch chairman in Mpophomeni. On 11 May 1993 an anonymous phone call was made to his house, alleging that three Mpophomeni residents were planning to kill him. The three men have denied the allegations. The South African Police (SAP) are seemingly reluctant to investigate these threats. Seven suspects have been charged in connection with five of the eleven murders that took place between 8 and 14 April 1993, including three men charged with the murder of Bheki Maseko and another man. However local residents feel that there are other suspects, and that police are not actively taking all possible steps to investigate the murders. "
