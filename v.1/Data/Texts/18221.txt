 Palestinian Authority: Fear for safety/Fear of unlawful killings, alleged Palestinian ""collaborators"" with Israeli intelligence services | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned at the abduction and   killing by Palestinian armed groups of Palestinians who   have allegedly collaborated with the Israeli intelligence services. These attacks have recently become increasingly frequent. More Palestinians are at risk of being killed   by the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and other armed groups, on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli intelligence.
