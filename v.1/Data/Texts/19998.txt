 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the health of Juan Carlos González Leiva, a 37-year- old blind lawyer, held  in Holguín prison in Holguín Province, Cuba. He           reportedly suffers from chest pain, high blood pressure   and a 'nervous condition', and claims to have received    threats from his cell mate. Juan Carlos González Leiva    reportedly had to have four stitches in his head as a     result of the police aggression on his arrest on 4 March  2002. Amnesty International received reports that         initially medical attention was denied to him although he was in severe pain."
