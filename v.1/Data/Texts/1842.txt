 Rwanda: Further information on Fear for Safety/Possible ""disappearance""/incommunicado detention | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of Major F_licien Ngirabatware, Damien Musayidizi, Dr. Leonard Hitimana, Augustin Cyiza and Elizier Runyaruka, who were arrested or are feared disappeared. They were targeted in the run-up to the 2003 presidential and parliamentary elections, partly because they were believed to pose a threat as opposition candidates or campaigners to the current Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) government.
