 'Abd al-Haris Mohammad Madani was arrested on 26 April 1994 in Cairo. He was reportedly so severely tortured at the Giza branch of the State Security Intelligence (SSI) that he had to be taken to the Qasr al-'Aini hospital. There is concern that he would be subjected to further torture if taken back into SSI custody. He is a laywer who has defended cases involving Islamists."
