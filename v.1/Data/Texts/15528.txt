 EXTRA 45/93 - Russian Federation: legal concern: Aleksandr Sergeyevich Chizhikov | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is calling for the release of Aleksandr Chizhikov, a 20-year-old pacifist and conscientious objector, who was sentenced to one years' imprisonment by a Moscow court on 21 April 1993. Article 45 of the Russian Constitution, amended in April 1992, provides for a civilian alternative to military service, which Aleksandr Chizhikov, has stated he is willing to perform. However the necessary enabling legislation has yet to be passed and conscription remains obligatory for able-bodied men between 18 and 27. An appeal hearing is scheduled in two weeks, which may prevent other such prosecutions proceeding, if his sentence is overturned. "
