 UA 229/93 - Brazil: death threats: Sister Elsa Rosa Zotti, and other Franciscan nuns | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Sister Elsa Zotti and other Franciscan nuns working with indigenous peoples in Escondido, Mato Grosso do Sul, who have been subjected to death threats. These are believed to come from local landowners and agents of lumber companies, who are targeting the Franciscan nuns for their work defending the rights of the indigenous people of Escondido, Cotriguacu region. Earlier this month two peasants declared in a civil court that they had heard the vice mayor of Cotriguacu stating that he had personally prevented the murder of Sister Elsa, but that she could be killed within the next few months, if she and the sisters continued to defend the demarcation of indigenous territory.
