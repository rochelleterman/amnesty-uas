 NA 
 Luis David Rodriguez Perez, a community worker and trade unionist, is being threatened and intimidated by members of the armed forces, who have recently accused him of being a member of the armed opposition. He has been harassed reportedly for several years, possibly because of his community and trade union work in Saraven, Arauca department. In July 1994 he was arbitrarily detained twice by security forces and in 1991 his house was searched and he was questioned at the local Attorney's office, where he was warned that he was under observation."
