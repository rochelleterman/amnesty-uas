 | Amnesty International 
 Philip Workman, aged 53, was executed by lethal injection in Tennessee in the early hours of 9 May despite evidence that a key state witness lied at his trial and that Lieutenant Ronald Oliver, the police officer Workman was convicted of killing during a 1981 robbery, may have been accidentally shot by a fellow officer. Philip Workman had been on death row for 25 years.
