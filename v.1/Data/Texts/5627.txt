 Narciso Gonzalez's wife is reported to have been told by an anonymous army officer that her husband was seen at the National Police Palace on 27 May 1994, the day after he ""disappeared"", and that he had subsequently been transferred to a military hospital. The authorities have still not acknowledged his detention, and he remains ""disappeared""."
