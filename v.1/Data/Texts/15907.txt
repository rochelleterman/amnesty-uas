 The Presidential Clemency Commission of Ukraine is due to re-examine Vasily Krivonos' petition for clemency in the next few days. He was sentenced to death by Vinitsky Regional Court on 18 November 1993. His appeal against the death sentence was rejected by the Supreme Court on 24 February 1994. There have been allegations that he has suffered severe and regular beatings on death row."
