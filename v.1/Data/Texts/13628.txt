 Maung Maung Than and Par Pa, two Burmese refugees recognized by the UNHCR, have been arrested by Thai security forces and arebeing detained in the Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) in Bangkok. Both had reportedly been invited to attend the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna. Maung Maung Than was arrested on 19 May and reportedly severely beaten, Par Pa was arrested sometime later. The reasons for their arrest are not known. Ko Htay Lwin, aged 25, who was suffering from a fatal heart condition, died from heart failure on 24 April 1993 in the Police Hospital after being taken there from the IDC where he had been held since his arrest on 9 April. There is concern at recent reports of other beatings of Burmese refugees, and poor conditions at the IDC. "
