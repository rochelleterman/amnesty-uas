 NA 
 This report describes how, since the independence of      Uzbekistan, scores of people, are executed every year     after unfair trials.  Among other things, the report      discusses such issues as torture to obtain confessions to crimes, how corruption is an integral part of the         investigation, and how the clemency process and the       executions themselves are shrouded in secrecy.
