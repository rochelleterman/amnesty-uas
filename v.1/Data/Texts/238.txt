 Burundi: Death penalty / execution / fear of further execution: Corporal Bonaventure Ndikumana | Amnesty International 
 Following the execution of Corporal Bonaventure Ndikumana on 29 July 1999, Amnesty International is gravely         concerned that hundreds of prisoners may now also face    imminent execution and that other soldiers could be       summarily executed after unfair trials.
