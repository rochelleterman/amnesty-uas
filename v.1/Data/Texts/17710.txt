 Ahmad Qatamesh's trial began on 3 December. During the first hearing the prosecution apparently revealed that an order for his administrative detention has been issued and is currently in his file pending the outcome of the trial, which resumes on 13 December. The judge is expected to decide then whether to remand him further in custody on the charges against him. His health is said to be much better. Ahmad Sa'adat was charged on 22 November with falsification of an identity card. However, he was later issued with a six-month detention order; it is not clear if the first charge has been dropped. AI is still seeking information about the allegations of torture and ill-treatment made by the detainees. "
