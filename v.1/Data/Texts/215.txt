 Burundi: Further Information on torture and legal concern | Amnesty International 
 Jean Minani, accused of killing Lieutenant Colonel Lucien Sakubu, a former mayor of Bujumbura, in March 1995, is currently awaiting trial before the criminal chamber of the cour d'appel (appeal court) in Bujumbura. Amnesty International is concerned that he may be convicted and sentenced to death on the basis of a confession made under torture. Six other people detained in connection with the murder, including Tharcisse Nzimpora, will reportedly be tried before a different court.
