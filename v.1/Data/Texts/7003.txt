 AI is concerned for the safety of members of the Jeresano family, who have reportedly been subjected to death threats, harassment and surveillance since the killing in early 1995 of Norma Bessy Jeresano de Rivas's husband, Juan Pablo Rivas Calderon. The family believes that the harassment is intended to intimidate them and other witnesses, in order to stall the investigation into the killing of Juan Pablo Rivas Calderon. No progress appears to have been made in this investigation."
