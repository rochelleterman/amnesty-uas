 UA 387/94 - Colombia: fear for safety: Luis Guillermo Perez Casas, Pedro Julio Mahecha Avila | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There are fears for the safety of two human rights lawyers working for the lawyers collective ""Corporacion Colectivo de Abogados Jose Alvear Restrepo"" (CCA). On 26 October two men followed Luis Guillermo Perez Casas to his office in Santafe de Bogota and followed his family to his son's school gates. The CCA have reported similar incidents during the last three weeks. The CCA is working on numerous important cases of human rights violations in which members of the police and army are implicated and its lawyers have been subjected to death threats and harassment in the past."
