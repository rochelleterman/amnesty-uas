 DRC: Execution / legal concern / fear of imminent executions | Amnesty International 
 Kanyongo Kisase, executed, and eight soldiers sentenced to death: Kanyongo Kisase was executed on 22 October 1997. His is the first judicial execution to be carried out since the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) took power in Kinshasa on 17 May 1997. There is also subsequent concern that eight soldiers, convicted and sentenced to death on 27 September, after being tried for attempted mutiny, now face imminent execution.
