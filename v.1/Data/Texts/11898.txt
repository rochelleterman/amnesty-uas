 Two Turkish Kurdish men who have sought asylum in Japan are facing forcible return to Turkey, where they would be at risk of torture. One of the men has been recognised as a refugee by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Amnesty International is not revealing the names of the men due to concerns for the safety of the men and their families.
