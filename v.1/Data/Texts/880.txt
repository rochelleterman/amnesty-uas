 Journalist Eskinder Negga, one of the 76 journalists, human rights defenders and opposition political supporters currently on trial in the capital, Addis Ababa, has reportedly been moved to a prison where he may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment and where conditions are very harsh. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression.
