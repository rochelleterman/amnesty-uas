 There is concern at the continued use of excessive force against demonstrators by security forces. During a mutiny over pay by soldiers of the Presidential Guard on 15 May 1993 Hermine Yakite was shot as soldiers tried to commandeer her car. She had been on her way to the hospital to give birth. On 4 June a march by women protesting against pay arrears, school closures and lack of health facilities, which was banned by the authorities, was brutally dispersed when troops opened fire and used sticks and leather whips against the demonstrators. According to reports one man reportedly died and at least two others required hospital treatment."
