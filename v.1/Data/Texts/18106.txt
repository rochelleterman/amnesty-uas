 Lebanon: Further information on fear of torture / legal concern and new concern: fear of unfair trial: Pierre 'Attalah | Amnesty International 
 On 14 May 1997 a military magistrate demanded between three and 15 years' imprisonment with hard labour for journalist Pierre 'Attallah. No date has been set for the trial, but it is thought to be imminent. There is concern that he is reportedly being charged in relation to a published interview he conducted in his capacity as a journalist and that if convicted he would be a prisoner of conscience.
