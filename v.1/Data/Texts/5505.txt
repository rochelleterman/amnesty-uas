 According to Cuban news agency reports, Jose Ariel Machado Rojas was sentenced to death on 14 October by the Villa Clara People's Provincial Tribunal after being convicted of murder. His case will now be reviewed, but the review process and execution in some cases take only a matter of days or weeks. This is the second death sentence to be passed this month and comes in the wake of statements from the authorities vowing to crack down on crime and internal unrest. "
