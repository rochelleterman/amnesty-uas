 At least 26 people suspected of involvement in two separate coup attempts are feared to have been executed in Freetown following unfair trials before a special military tribunal on 29-30 December 1992. The defendants were reportedly executed on 30 December, hours after the verdict was confirmed. They include James Bambay Kamara, former Minister of State and Inspector General of Police and Lieutenant Colonel James Yaya Kanu. Both had been detained since April 1992 but were allegedly convicted of involvement in a coup attempt on 28 December 1992. "
