 Kenya: Arbitrary arrest / fear of ill-treatment / fear of refoulement | Amnesty International 
 More than 80 Rwandese nationals including: Emmanuel Bizimana, Speciose Kayitesi (f), Appollinaire Kanyenzi and his wife, Alfred Munyandekwe, Moise Ntunda, Bertrude Mukasanga (f), Evariste Nyerengoga, Mediatrice Mukantagara (f), Marie-Therese Mbonabarigi, Chris Kabera, Straton Bizimana; several Burundi nationals, including a 40-year-old woman: There is concern at reports that more than 80 Rwandese nationals were arbitrarily arrested by Kenyan police between 18 and 21 July 1997. Their arrests follow the arrest of seven other Rwandese in Nairobi at the request of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on suspicion of having played a role in the genocide there in 1994. However, the 80 who were arrested are not known to face similar accusations and there is concern that they may be subject to ill-treatment in detention and possible deportation to Rwanda where they would be at risk. Several Burundi nationals were also reportedly arrested.
