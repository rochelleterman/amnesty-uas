 USA: ""Double jeopardy"" for some Guantánamo detainees | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Held in isolating conditions, the detainees held in Guantánamo Bay have not been allowed to see lawyers or    relatives, or to have access to any court. Now, even if   eventually released with no charge, some may face further injustice: indefinite untried detention, torture or       execution in their home country"
