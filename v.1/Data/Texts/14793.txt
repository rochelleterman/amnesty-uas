 There is concern for the safety of the four Kurdish villagers named above who are being held in incommunicado detention at the Diyarbakir gendarmerie headquarters following an assault on their village by security forces. At 6am on 21 June 1993 soldiers entered the village of Ortasar (Kurdish: Elvendi), near Cinar, Diyarbakir province, and assembled the 600 villagers. They were then subjected to torture and ill-treatment until 10.30pm. The village had refused to join the village guard militia. Some villagers who were detained were later released, including Veysi Dagli, Suleyman Temiz and Ahmet Kertis, allegedly after being tortured. On 25 June the troops reportedly returned and threatened to kill the villagers if they told outsiders what had happened. "
