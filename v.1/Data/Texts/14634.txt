 Turkey: Fear for safety/'Disappearance'  Ahmet Ece (m) | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of      Ahmet Ece, who has apparently 'disappeared'  following a   phone call to his relatives on 23 September. He is        believed to be in gendarmerie detention or police         custody, where he is at risk of torture or               ill-treatment. However, the authorities deny his          detention.
