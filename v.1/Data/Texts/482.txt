 Central African Republic: ""Disappearance"" / Fear of torture or ill-treatment / Fear of extrajudicial          execution	 | Amnesty International 
 At least 20 and possibly many more people have reportedly been summarily executed or subjected to human rights abuses following a failed coup attempt in Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic (CAR). Many people, including Maxime Koko, have ""disappeared"" and are thought to be at risk of extrajudicial execution. Others, including Jean-Pierre Gueret, are held in detention centres, where they are at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Amnesty International is concerned for their safety.
