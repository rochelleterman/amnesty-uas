 Venezuela: Prisoner of conscience / fear of torture / ill-treatment / health concern: Jose Antonio Landaeta Gatica, carpenter | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International considers that he is a prisoner of conscience, administratively detained, on account of his town of origin, under the Law of Vagrants and Crooks, which allows for administrative detention and imprisonment without detainees having access to court hearing, legal defence or a fair trial. He was severely beaten at the time of his arrest and has reportedly still not received medical treatment for the injuries he sustained as a result. He is feared to be facing imminent transfer to a prison where the conditions are known to be appalling and where he would be at risk of further ill-treament or torture.
