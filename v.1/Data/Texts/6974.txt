 NA 
 At least one man and possibly other civilians have reportedly been killed by Haitian police who attacked crowds demonstrating for the return of President Aristide and welcoming the arrival of US troops. Demonstrators are also reported to have thrown rocks and rotting coconuts at police, and there have been reports that a policeman was shot and wounded by a civilian. The US troops have stood aside and are apparently under orders not to get involved."
