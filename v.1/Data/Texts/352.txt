 Eight men and one boy aged 17 are being tried on charges of practising homosexuality, which is a criminal offence under Section 347a of the Cameroonian Penal Code. They are detained in harsh conditions and are at risk of ill-treatment. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely because of their alleged sexual orientation.
