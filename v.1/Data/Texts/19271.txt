 Tunisia: Further information on health concern / possible prisoner of conscience and new concern: prisoner of conscience: Najib El Baccouchi | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International fears that prisoner of conscience Najib El Baccouchi, a member of the General Union of Tunisian Students, UGET, may be subjected to cruel and degrading treatment in punishment for having been on hunger-strike since 13 November 1996. The organization also fears that his health may be seriously affected. He was imprisoned on a charge of racism which he denies.
