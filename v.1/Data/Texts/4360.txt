 Colombia: Fear for safety: Trade unionists and social activists in Barrancabermeja, Department of Santander

 | Amnesty International 
 A gunman allegedly from an army-backed paramilitary group has killed a trade union member in the city of Barrancabermeja, Santander Department. The same day a regional newspaper had reported that a paramilitary group was threatening to kill all members of trade unions and social organizations standing in the region in the 12 March congressional elections. Amnesty International believes that all trade unionists and other social activists in Barrancabermeja are in grave danger.
