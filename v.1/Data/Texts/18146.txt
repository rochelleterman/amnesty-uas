 Libya: Further information on: Forcible return/fear for safety/fear of torture	 | Amnesty International 
 The Libyan authorities attempted to forcibly return a further 76 Eritrean asylum-seekers, including 22 women and six children, on 27 August. Some of the Eritreans hijacked the plane that was carrying them, and forced it to land in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, where they have all applied for refugee protection. There is no new information about over 110 asylum-seekers forcibly returned by Libya to Eritrea on 21 July. They are believed to be detained incommunicado in a secret prison in Dahlak Kebir island on the Red Sea, where conditions are harsh.
