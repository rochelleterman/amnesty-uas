 Salih Guler, a correspondent on Ozgur Ulke (Free Land) newspaper in Diyarbakir, was detained on 4 January 1995 when plainclothes police officers raided the newspaper's offices. They reportedly handed him over to the Gendarmerie Intelligence Headquarters in Diyarbakir. It is feared that he is being tortured in incommunicado detention. Two other journalists on the paper, Erdogan Zamur and Turker Alp, have allegedly been tortured in police custody in recent weeks. A description of the torture of one of them is included here."
