 | Amnesty International 
 On 9 November, the Supreme Court in Oman upheld the death sentence against US national Rebecca Thompson. Her sentence, which is now at the final stage of the appeal process, is expected to be referred to the Sultan of Oman. The Sultan has the power either to confirm or commute the sentence - if confirmed, she would be at risk of imminent execution.
