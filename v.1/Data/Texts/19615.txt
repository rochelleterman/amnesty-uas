 Somalia: Imminent execution/unfair trial: Ifraah Ali Aden (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ifraah Ali Aden is in imminent danger of being executed for the murder of another woman, Suad Mohamed Aware, who was another of her husband's wives. She was convicted after an unfair trial. The warrant for her execution does not set a date, and it appears that she could be put to death at any time."
