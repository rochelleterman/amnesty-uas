 UA 287/92 - Angola: arbitrary killings: Teresa Mzovo, Pascoal Pitra, Pedro Mbachi Ngimbi, Placido Tati and others | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 At least six people have been shot dead and others injured in a wave of violence by government soldiers in Cabinda which started on 4 September, allegedly after two soldiers were killed by members of the armed group FLEC (Cabinda Enclave Liberation Front). The rioting soldiers are reported to have taken civilians and UN peace monitors prisoner, most of whom they released later. AI is urging the government to take steps to bring the soldiers under control and inquire into their grievances; apparently they are in revolt because they have not been demobilized and because they have not received full pay or rations for several months.
