 Italy: Further information on Forcible return/fear for safety/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 The Italian authorities forcibly returned at least 45 people to Libya on 22 June, where they may be at risk of serious human rights violations, including torture. They were not given an effective opportunity to apply for asylum and have their claims assessed in a fair and satisfactory asylum procedure. Many more foreign nationals have recently arrived on the island of Lampedusa and as of 22 June 866 people were reportedly detained in the temporary holding centre for foreign nationals on the island. The authorities are reportedly planning further deportations.
