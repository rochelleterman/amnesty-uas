 Burundi: Fear of ill-treatment / torture / possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Reverend Emmanuel Ndayiziga, president and legal representative of the Union of Baptist Churches in Burundi, Reverend Eliezer Ntunzwenimana, and another pastor (name unknown): In March 1997 three pastors from the same church were arrested and are currently held at the Special Investigation Brigade (BSR) headquarters in Bujumbura, where they have reportedly been ill-treated. They have not been charged, but it is believed they may have been targeted for arrest on account of their welfare work among the local Hutu population.
