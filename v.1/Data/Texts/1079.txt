 AI is concerned about the continued detention of the first prisoner named above, Njenga Mungai. The others have all been released. Njenga Mungai is still being held under armed guard in Nakuru provincial hospital, chained to the bed at night. He is charged with sedition. He was refused bail on grounds that he has two previous charges of sedition outstanding. AI is calling for him to be released."
