 Colombia: Fear for safety - Family of Nydia Erika         Bautista,and Human rights lawyers | Amnesty International 
 The family of a woman who ""disappeared"" 13 years ago, and human rights lawyers, have objected to the military       justice system's handling of the case. Military justice   officials have begun trying to contact the family         directly, rather than through their legal                 representatives, and Amnesty International fears that     their objections will put them in grave danger.
