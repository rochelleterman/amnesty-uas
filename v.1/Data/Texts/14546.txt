 Serif Avsar has been found dead near the village of Topraki, Silvan district. An autopsy reportedly established that he had been killed some 10 days earlier, five days after his ""disappearance"" on 22 April. He had been abducted from his family's business premises by five village guards and two plainclothes men believed to be members of the gendarmerie intelligence service JITEM. The five village guards have reportedly been detained. However there remains concern for the safety of other members of his family."
