 UA 302/94 - Turkey: fear of ""disappearance"" / torture / medical concern: Besir Ozen | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 27 July 1994 Besir Ozen, aged 70, and his 13-year-old daughter, Gulistan Ozen, were arrested from their home in the Omerli district of Mardin by plainclothes police. Gulistan Ozen was released on 30 July and reported that her father had been severely tortured in custody. A worker at the Mardin State Hospital informed the Ozen family that Besir Ozen was brought into hospital on 5 August bleeding from a haemorrhage in his stomach, but was taken away after treatment. The Mardin Prosecutor has repeatedly denied that Besir Ozen is detained and there is serious concern for his safety."
