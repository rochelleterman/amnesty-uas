 Iran: Imminent execution: Kobra Rahmanpour (f) | Amnesty International 
 It is feared that Kobra Rahmanpour, aged about 25, is at imminent risk of execution for murder. The Office for the Implementation of Sentences, which carries out executions, has set a deadline of 12 October for the family of the murder victim to agree to forgo their right to have Kobra Rahmanpour executed, and accept the payment of diyeh (blood money) instead. If they continue to ask for the execution to be implemented, it is likely to be carried out soon after 12 October.
