 UA 248/93 - Turkey: ""disappearance"": Ihsan Haran | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Ihsan Haran, of Arikli village, Lice, who was detained on or around the 22 July 1993 at a road block in Hazro town, Diyarbakir province, by gendarmerie an village guards. His family submitted a petition to Hazro Chief Prosecutor on 29 July, but were told that he had not been informed of Ihsan Haran's detention. The same day the family received an anonymous phone call claiming that Ihsan Haran had been released, but he has not reappeared. The family report that they have frequently been the target of threats by the security forces, because two of the extended family reportedly joined the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) guerrillas, and two others are remanded in custody on charges of harbouring guerrillas.
