 NA 
 Gordon Micah Kur, a social worker and prisoner of conscience, is currently being held without charge or trial in Kober Prison in Khartoum after being arrested in February 1995 and held incommunicado. He has been repeatedly harassed by the authorities, apparently becuase of his work between 1987 and 1989 with the Sudan Amputees' Association, SSA, a welfare organization set up to help the victims of hand and foot amputation sentences. He was previously detained as a prisoner of conscience between September 1989 and June 1991."
