"Ecuador: Fear for safety 
 Ecuador:  Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Guadalupe de Heredia has been the target of a campaign of intimidation, which has included violent attacks. She is the press officer of the legal team representing indigenous communities taking legal action against the multinational oil company ChevronTexaco for failing to clean up the pollution caused by decades of drilling in the oil-rich Sucumbios region. Amnesty International fears that her life and those of her family may be in danger. The attack on her is also believed to be aimed at intimidating the legal team working on the case. Five lawyers and human rights defenders from this team (Dr Alejandro Ponce Villacçs, Dr Pablo Fajardo Mendoza, Ermel Chævez Parra, Cærmen Allauca and Luis Yanza) have been threatened before.
