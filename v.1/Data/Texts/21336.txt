 Abdelilah Ghailán and Fátima Zohra Alami Wahabi and their two children are at risk of being forcibly evicted from their homes in Madrid, Spain, from 24 June 2011. The eviction has been ordered without prior consultation and the family has not been offered any alternative housing. Hundreds of other families living in the same area could suffer a similar fate."
