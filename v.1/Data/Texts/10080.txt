 USA (Louisiana):   Unfair Trial: Gary Tyler (m) | Amnesty International 
 Gary Tyler, a 49-year-old black African American, has      spent more than 33 years in prison in Louisiana after     being convicted of murder in the shooting of a white      schoolboy during a racially charged incident in 1974.     Aged 16 at the time, Gary Tyler has consistently          maintained his innocence of the murder and federal        reviewing courts have declared his trial fundamentally    unfair.
