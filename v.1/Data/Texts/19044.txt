 NA 
 Jalel Maaleg was tried in Sfax on 4 February 1995 on charges of membership of an unauthorized association (Al-Nahda) and of attending meetings of this association in France (where attending such a meeting is not an offence). He denies both charges. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment and a further two years' ""controle administratif"", which means having to report regularly to the police. AI has adopted him as a prisoner of conscience."
