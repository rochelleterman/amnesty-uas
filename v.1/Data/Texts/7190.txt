 On 15 January, a car belonging to human rights defender Erândira Cruzvillegas was vandalised in the city of Oaxaca, Oaxaca State. Amnesty International believes the incident and a series of anonymous threats she received in December 2004 are aimed at deterring her from her human rights work. She and other human rights defenders in Oaxaca State may be in danger.
