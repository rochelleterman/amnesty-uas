 Benito Bahena Maldonado; and new names: Fredy Nava Rios (16), army recruit and Miguel Castro Munillo, peasant activist: Amnesty International remains gravely concerned for the physical safety of Benito Bahena Maldonado, last seen in a detention centre in Mexico City at the end of June 1997. The organization has now also learnt of the ""disappearance"" of two other men from the same region, Fredy Nava Rios, detained on 29 May 1997, and Miguel Castro Munillo who was last seen on 4 April 1997 as he passed through a checkpoint of the Attorney General of the Republic. It is feared he has been detained for his involvement in a peasant organization, Coalition of Small Farm holders of the Costa Grande, and a political party, Party of the Democratic Revolution, (PRD).
