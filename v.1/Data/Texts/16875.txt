 AI fears that Mollah Ahmad Khezri and Kajid Sulduzi may be subjected to torture and be a risk of imminent execution. They are apparently being held in Orumiyeh prison without charge or trial. They were reportedly abducted on 26 January 1995 at a checkpoint on their way to Rawanduz in Iraqi Kurdistan and handed over to the Iranian authorties."
