 There is concern that the above Tunisian nationals are at risk of expulsion to Tunisia, where they face torture, ill-treatment and imprisonment after unfair trial. They were arrested in Algiers on 9 February 1994. They had sought asylum in Algeria, as they feared persecution in Tunisia, because of their support for the unauthorized Islamist movement al-Nahda. All seven are registered with the Office of the UNHCR in Algiers. The only reason given for their arrest was reportedly that their home address did not concur with the one registered with the police."
