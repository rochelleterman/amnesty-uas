 Cambodia: Further information on  Fear of forcible return/fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 The USA has offered to accept all the ethnic minority asylum-seekers now in two camps in Cambodia. However, it is not known how many will want to resettle in the USA. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen announced on 31 March that Cambodia agreed in principle to the US offer, which has not yet been formalised, but said that no more asylum-seekers would be allowed to enter the country from Viet Nam, and any who did would be deported. Some 400 soldiers have reportedly been sent to Cambodia's northeast border with Viet Nam, the region where the asylum-seekers entered the country.
