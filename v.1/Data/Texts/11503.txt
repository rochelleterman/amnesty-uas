 Xanana Gusmao, leader of East Timor's independence movement, the Conselho Nacional de Resistencia Maubere, was arrested by the military on 20 November 1992 in Dili. He is currently detained incommunicado. There are fears that he may be ill-treated in detention. Several members of the Araujo family, including a 74-year-old woman, are also in incommunicado detention; they were arrested along with Xanana Gusmao. There has been no official clarification of the whereabouts of the above-named people. Government sources have said that Xanana Gusmao is ""undergoing intensive questioning""; on 22 November AI's request for the ICRC to have access to him was rejected. AI remains concerned about the well-being of Xanana Gusmao and those arrested with him. "
