 AI remains seriously concerned about the Palestinian deportees who are still stranded in an area between the ""security zone"" controlled by Israel and the South Lebanon Army, and the rest of Lebanon. Three Palestinians have reportedly been injured by shelling by the SLA and the Israeli-held crossing points have reportedly been barricaded, with troops on standby to prevent any attempt to return to Israel. The Lebanese authorities have banned relief organizations from providing further humanitarian aid to the deportees. Most of the deportees are suspected by the Israeli authorities of being member of Hamas, which claimed repsonsibility for the killing of an Israeli Border Policeman last week. "
