 Israel/OPT: Further Information: Palestinian detainee resumes hunger strike: Samer al-Barq | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 After the Israeli authorities did not fulfil their promise to transfer Palestinian administrative detainee Samer al-Barq to Egypt, he resumed his hunger strike on 14 October, only three weeks after ending a four-month hunger strike. He and former hunger striker Hassan Safadi, also held without charge or trial, are still being denied the medical attention they need."
