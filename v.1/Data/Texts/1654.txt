 Nigeria: Further information on legal concern / health concern / prisoners of conscience / fear of death penalty: reportedly sentenced to death | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There have been reports of further arrests and secret trials in connection with the alleged coup plot of March 1995. AI is continuing to express concern that defendants at the trial before the Special Military Tribunal have been convicted on totally inadequate evidence; some have received the death penalty. AI is also concerned about recent new arrests. AI is calling for all death sentences to be commuted and for any prisoners of conscience among those detained to be released, and for the others either to be tried fairly and promptly or to be released."
