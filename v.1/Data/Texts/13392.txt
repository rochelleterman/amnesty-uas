 On 12 February 1998, five gunmen, suspected to be connected to the security forces, forcibly entered the home of Iqbal Athas and, after threatening him and his family, attempted to abduct him.  Amnesty International is seriously concerned for his safety, and fears that his attempted abduction may be due to his activities as a journalist.
