 Guatemala: fear for safety: Rev. Vitalino Similox, Pastor Lucio Martinez, Margarita de Similox | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is serious concern for the safety of the three people named above following death threats contained in letters they received on 14 July and 8 August 1995. In the first letter the three were warned against pursuing investigations into the death of Manuel Saquic Vasquez, an evangelical pastor and coordinator of the Kaqchikel Maya Human Rights Committee in Panabajal who was tortured and killed in June 1995. The letter was signed by a group calling itself Jaguar of Justice. In the second note they were given 24 hours to leave the country."
