 Human rights criteria that could save the lives of millions of people are at risk of being seriously weakened as the historic Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) is negotiated at the UN in New York.  Weakening these rules would mean that governments would be able to continue supplying deadly weapons to those who commit serious human rights abuses."
