 Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabian teacher arrested for protest | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A 25-year-old teacher was arrested on 4 March 2011 during a protest held in Riyadh calling for reform. On 2 March, a video of him calling for protests in support of the fall of the monarchy was posted on YouTube. Amnesty International is concerned that he may be held solely for the peaceful expression of his right to freedom of expression and may therefore be a prisoner of conscience."
