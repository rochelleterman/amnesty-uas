 At least 13 journalists are among scores of people arrested in their homes or offices since the disputed Iranian Presidential election on 12 June. The whereabouts of most are unknown, although those detained in Tehran are likely to be held in Evin Prison. All are feared to be at risk of torture or other ill-treatment."
