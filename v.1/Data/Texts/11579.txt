 UA 355/93 - Indonesia: death threats / harassment: Ahmad Jauhari | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is serious concern for the safety of Ahmad Jauhari, a 28-year-old lawyer. A note containing death threats against him was found shortly after his house was wrecked by ten men in the early hours of 6 October 1993. The violent attack and threats appear to have been motivated by his work on behalf of farming communities in the Bogor area of West Java. He works for the Ampera Legal Aid Institute (LBH-Ampera) in Bogor. "
