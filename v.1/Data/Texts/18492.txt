 Syrian Kurd Yassin Suleiman and his father, Akash, are still detained incommunicado, putting them at grave risk of torture and other ill-treatment. They have reportedly been held since 21 December 2006, a few weeks after Yassin Suleiman, his wife and daughter were forcibly returned to Damascus from Norway, after their asylum application was refused.
