 Iran: Further information on incommunicado detention/fear of torture/medical concern, prisoner of conscience. New concern: fear of flogging | Amnesty International 
 Abbas Lisani, a prominent activist for the rights of Iranian Azerbaijanis, was released on bail on 26 September 2006. He was redetained on 31 October 2006 by security forces, apparently without a warrant, in violation of Iranian law. His detention is apparently related to one of the several prison terms he is currently facing in relation to his participation in annual gatherings and other demonstrations of Iranian Azerbaijanis. He is believed to be held in Section 7 of Tabriz Prison in northwestern Iran. Amnesty International believes him to be a prisoner of conscience, held for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression and of association.
