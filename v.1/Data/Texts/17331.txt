 Iran: Fear for safety/ Fear of torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 At least six students from Amir Kabir Polytechnic in      Tehran, have been arrested and are believed to be held in the city's Evin Prison. Amnesty International fears that  they may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Ahmad    Qasabian, Moqdad Khalilpour, Pooya  Mahmoudian, Majid     Tavakkoli and Majid Sheikhpour were reportedly detained   apparently in connection with articles deemed by          university officials to ""insult Islamic sanctities"".      Another student, Babak Zamanian, was reportedly arrested  and appeared in court on 25 April.
