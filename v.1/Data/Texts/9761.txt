 EXTRA 99/92 - USA (Virginia): death penalty: Timothy Bunch | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Timothy Bunch, white, is scheduled to be executed in Virginia on 10 December 1992. He was sentenced to death in November 1982 for the murder of a woman Su Cha Thomas. At his trial he had reportedly poor legal representation: the court-appointed lawyers were inexperienced and failed to present mitigating evidence which included information about Timothy Bunch's disturbed family background and his lack of any criminal record or history of violence. Only one defence witness, his mother, was called to testify, despite the apparent availability of many other witnesses. "
