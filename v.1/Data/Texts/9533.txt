 USA: Further Information on Fear of forcible return / Fear of torture / Fear of  execution | Amnesty International 
 Ethnic Uighurs in US military custody in Guant‡namo Bay, Cuba, are feared to remain at risk of forcible return to China or to third countries where they might face return to China. Any Uighurs suspected of ""separatist"" or ""terrorist"" activities would be at risk of serious human rights violations, including unfair trials, torture and execution, if forcibly returned to China. The seven Russian detainees transferred from Guant‡namo Bay to continued detention in Russia in late February are believed to remain in detention without charge or trial.
