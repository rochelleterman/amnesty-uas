 Israel/OPT: Health Professional Action: Patients from Gaza are still denied access to medical treatment in Israel | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Israeli authorities are still denying scores of critically ill patients the authorization they need to leave Gaza for medical treatment that is unavailable in Gaza. Even those patients who are given permission to leave Gaza for treatment are often suffering as a result of delays in receiving exit permits, which contribute to a decline in patientâ€™s health and emotional well-being."
