 Malaysia: Further information on Fear of torture or ill-treatment / incommunicado detention | Amnesty International 
 On 7 December 2001 the Minister of Home Affairs ordered the 6 of the men named to be detained for two years without trial under the Internal Security Act. Amnesty International fears that the police may have subjected them to intense psychological pressure amounting to torture, or to physical abuse, during interrogation. However, no information is available about their state of health. One of them is reported to have been released unconditionally after being held for 55 days in incommunicado detention.
