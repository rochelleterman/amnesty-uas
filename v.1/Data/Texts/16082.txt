 Tajikistan: Medical concern / political prisoner: Abdulkhafiz Abdullayev | Amnesty International 
 AI is gravely concerned at reports that Abdulkhafiz Abdullayev is critically ill and is in imminent danger of dying if he does not receive the necessary medical attention that the progression of his cancer requires. He detained since May 1997 and was charged at the time with illegal possession of narcotics. It was subsequently reported that he had been charged in connection with an assassination attempt on the President of Tajikistan in April 1997.
