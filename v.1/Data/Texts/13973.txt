 The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe ruled on 9 February 1995 that Fariz Simsek should not be deported before 15 March 1995 at the latest, unless an official medical assessment certified that he was not at risk of suicide in the case of such a deportation. A further ruling is possible later. Fariz Simsek was released from deportation detention on 1 February and is now with his family, awaiting the outcome of various judicial proceedings which his lawyers have initiated."
