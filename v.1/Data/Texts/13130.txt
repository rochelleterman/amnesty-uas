 Philippines: Imminent execution: Leo Echegaray | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International fears that Leo Echegaray may imminently be executed by lethal injection, following the issuing of a death warrant.  Echegaray's only hope now lies with President Estrada, who has the power to grant clemency. If this execution goes ahead, it will be the first in more than 20 years in the Philippines.
