 AI is concerned about the incommunicado detention, without charge or trial, of a former head of state as well as other civilians and serving officers of the armed forces. The reason for the arrests is not clear but is believed to be in connection with an alleged plot against the military government. AI fears that some of them may be prisoners of conscience, imprisoned for non-violent expression of their political views; if so, AI is calling for them to be released immediately and unconditionally."
