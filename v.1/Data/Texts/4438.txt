 NA 
 The exhumation of corpses, believed to be of peasant farmers ""disappeared"" from the village of Pueblo Bello, Antioquia department, has just begun at Monteria cemetery, near Pueblo Bello. There is serious concern for the safety of relatives, human rights workers and forensic scientists present at the exhumation, scheduled to continue until 7 April 1995. AI is concerned for their safety. AI is also concerned that the alleged perpetrators of the massacre, Fidel Castano Gil, a known drug-trafficker and rancher, and paramilitaries working for him, remain at liberty."
