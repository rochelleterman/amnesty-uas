 Medical Action: Russian Federation: For a full and decent life - Action to promote the rights of children with mental disabilities 

 | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 This medical action highlights the situation suffered by more than 19,000 children up to the age of four who are   housed in children's homes and around 29,000 children in  internats in the Russian Federation.  Some of these       children are orphans but a large number are confined      purely because of their mental disability, including      Down's Syndrome, autism, epilepsy and cerebral palsy."
