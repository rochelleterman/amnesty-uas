 Yemen: Further information on Incommunicado detention/Fear of torture/Medical concern | Amnesty International 
 Brigadier Nasser al-Nouba, Shallal Ali Shaya' and scores of others arrested after a protest on 2 August, have been released by the Yemeni authorities. However, 'Abbas       al-'Assal and Nasser al-'Awlaqi, detained at the same     time, are still reported to be held incommunicado.        Amnesty International is concerned that they may be       prisoners of conscience, held solely for peacefully       exercising their rights to freedom of expression and      freedom of assembly.
