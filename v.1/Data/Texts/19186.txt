"Tunisia: Legal concern: Mohamed Mouadda 
 Tunisia: Legal concern: Mohamed Mouadda | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is seriously concerned about the arrest and incommunicado detention of Mohamed Mouadda, the leader of the Movement of Democratic Socialists, a legal opposition party in Tunisia. His arrest occurred after the MDS sent a letter to the President of Tunisia on 21 September raising the party's concerns about the current political situation in Tunisia. AI is concerned that Mohammed Mouadda may be held solely on account of his peaceful political activities and fears that he is at risk of unfair trial."
