 Moise Paul and Emile Georges, both supporters of President Aristide, ""disappeared"" on 16 and 18 July 1994 respectively from Cite Soleil, a slum on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. It is believed that they may have been abducted by the military or by attaches. Concern for their safety is heightened by reports of a massacre of at least 12 people after their bodies were found on 12 July in the small town of Morne-a-Bateau. It is reported that the massacre occurred after the military attacked participants in a pro-Aristide demonstration."
