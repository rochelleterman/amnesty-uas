 Israel: House Demolition/forced eviction/medical concern

 | Amnesty International 
 The Jerusalem Municipality is preparing to forcibly evict Muhammad Is'hac and Yousra Herbawi from the house where they live with their six children, one of whom, Mansur, aged 24, is severely disabled, and then to demolish the building. The family have almost no income, and would be left destitute. The impact on the family's health, in particular that of the disabled son, is likely to be very severe. The other five children are aged between 13 and 21.
