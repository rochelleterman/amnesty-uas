 Iran: Further information on Death penalty/imminent execution: Makwan Moloudzadeh (m) | Amnesty International 
 On 14 November 2007, a branch of the Supreme Court heard an appeal against the death sentence imposed on child offender Makwan Moloudzadeh. At some time during the next few months, the Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether the sentence passed on Makwan Moloudzadeh remains valid. 
 Child offender Makwan Moloudzadeh was hanged on 4 December 2007 in Kermanshah Central Prison. He had been sentenced to death in July 2007 for lavat-e iqabi (anal sex) in connection with the alleged rape of three boys in about 1999, when Makwan Moloudzadeh was aged 13. "
