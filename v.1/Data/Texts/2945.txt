 All the students named above have been released on bail. Hassan Harri and Ashraf Alhillo were released at the beginning of May, whilst the other students were released at the end of the month. All have been charged with ""Rioting"" and ""Disturbance of Public Peace"". The students' trial began on 4 June and on 8 July all were convicted following what Amnesty International considers to be an unfair trial. The students had no legal representation in court, because lawyers attached to the case were allegedly intimidated by the authorities.
