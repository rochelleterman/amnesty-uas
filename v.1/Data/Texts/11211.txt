 AI is concerned about continuing reports of deaths in custody in Jammu and Kashmir. The most recent such death reportedly occurred on 21 April 1993, when police constable Riaz Ahmed died in army custody. He had been picked up on 21 April 1993, on suspicion of aiding Kashmiri militants. Policemen in the state, who went on strike in protest at his death, apparently suspect that he was tortured and killed in custody. Government authorities maintain that he was killed in crossfire between the army and militants. "
