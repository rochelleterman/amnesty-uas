 Burundi: Fear of torture and ill-treatment / ""disappearance"" | Amnesty International 
 Eight people from Rukaramu, in Mutimbuzi commune, outside the capital, Bujumbura, were arrested by soldiers on 10 December on suspicion of involvement in the murder of a soldier. Torture and ill-treatment are rife in military and gendarmerie custody and Amnesty International is seriously concerned for their safety, in particular because they have been accused of involvement in the murder of a soldier.
