 On 22 September, the trial of 44 defendants, mostly ethnic Albanian former police officers, ended in Prizren. Thirty-eight defendants were convicted of seeking to undermine Yugoslavia's integrity by force by preparing to set up a ""parallel"" or clandestine ethnic Albanian police force in Kosovo Province. They were sentenced to prison terms ranging between one and six years' imprisonment. Six defendants remained in detention, the others were released pending appeal. Charges against three defendants were withdrawn and two defendants were acquitted by the court. One case, against Halil Blakaj, will be tried separately."
