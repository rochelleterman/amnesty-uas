 Domingo Rafael Tovar and Jorge Ortega Garcia, members of the National Executive of the United Confederation of Workers (CUT) are reported to have received written and telephoned death threats in the last few days. Jorge Ortega Garcia has also been kept under surveillance at his office and has been followed by members of the security forces. On 12 February 1994 they were detained by members of the army's XIII Brigade, accused of ""rebellion"". Judicial authorities later ordered their release. There is grave concern for their safety."
