 Army sergeant Noel de Jesus Beteta Alvarez was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment for the murder of anthropologist and founder member of AVANCSO Myrna Mack Chang and for a separate assault on a minor. There are grave fears that following recent incidents of intimidation, certain sectors of the security forces may make reprisals against the family and associates of Myrna Mack Chang. "
