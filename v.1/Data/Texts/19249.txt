 Tunisia: Further information on prisoner of conscience / fear of ill-treatment and new concern: torture / medical concern: Abdel Moumen Belanes | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is gravely concerned at reports that prisoner of conscience Abdel Moumen Belanes was tortured for several hours on 30 April 1997, and again on 2 May, by 12 prison guards, while being detained incommunicado. His lawyers were allowed to see him on 24 May 1997 but have been prevented from visiting him since. They reported that he was in bad health and was being held in poor conditions of detention.
