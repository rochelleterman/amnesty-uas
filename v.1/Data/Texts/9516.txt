 EXTRA 83/93 - USA (Texas): death penalty: Robert Nelson Drew | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Robert Drew, white, is scheduled to be executed on 14 October 1993. He was sentenced to death in December 1983 for the murder of Jeffrey Mays. He was convicted largely on the testimony of an eye witness who has since recanted his testimony. According to his attorneys shortly after Robert Drew was convicted, a co-defendant who was sentenced to 60 years imprisonment for his part in the crime, boasted to two fellow inmates that he alone had killed Mr Mays. He later signed an affidavit to this effect. Robert Drew's attorneys have appealed without success for a retrial based on this late evidence of innocence because it was discovered too late. Texas law requires that a new trial motion based on newly discovered evidence should be made within 30 days of sentence. "
