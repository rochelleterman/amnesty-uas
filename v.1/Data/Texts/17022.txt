 According to reports, the two women named above are at risk of execution by stoning. They were apparently sentenced to death for adultery in June 1995 by a court in Ilam Gharb, a small town in Western Iran. They were sentenced under the Law of Hodoud and Qesas, which prescribes that adultery by a married woman with an adult male shall be punished by stoning to death. The sentence has yet to be confirmed by the Supreme Court. AI is appealing for the sentences to be commuted."
