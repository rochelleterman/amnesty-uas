 UA 324/93 - Lebanon: killing of demonstrators / fear for safety: Eight civilians | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 13 September eight civilians were killed and about 30 others were inured when soldiers fired on a demonstration in Beirut against the signing of the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization in Washington. The demonstration had been organized by Hizbullah (Party of God). Soldiers are said to have ordered the demonstrators to turn back, then fired into the air, and finally to have fired into the crowd, killing at least six men and two women, and injuring others. Demonstrations appear to have been banned in Lebanon since late July 1993. "
