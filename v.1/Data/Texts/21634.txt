 A wheelchair bound prisoner, Zhasulan Suleimenov, has been kept in solitary confinement in Kazakhstan for more than 11 months. He has been denied direct access to drinking water, basic hygiene and necessary medical care. His health is deteriorating and he urgently needs to be moved to a hospital outside the prison system for independent examination and essential medical treatment. "
