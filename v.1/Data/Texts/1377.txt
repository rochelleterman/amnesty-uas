 Vera Chirwa, 60-year-old prisoner of conscience and widow of Orton Chirwa, also a prisoner of conscience, who died on 20 October 1992, has been allowed to receive a visit from her children, who were visiting Malawi for the funeral of their father. In a previous follow-up to this Urgent Action (AFR 36/42/92) it was stated that the funeral had passed off peacefully. AI has since learned that, although the ceremony itself was peaceful, youths reportedly beat to death a person who had allegedly tried to throw a grenade at a vehicle carrying members of the Chirwa family.
