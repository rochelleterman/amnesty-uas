 UA 169/94 - India: ""disappearance"" / fear of torture: Sherpal | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Sherpal, thought to be a member of the Baveriya caste, has ""disappeared"" after being detained by police on 4 February 1994 in Uttar Pradesh. He was last seen in police custody on 1 March 1994, when he was reported to have severe injuries. AI is concerned that he is being tortured and is being kept in unacknowledged detention, or that he may even have been killed in custody."
