 AI fears that Vahid Ghadimi, aged 47, may be at risk of imminent execution. According to Iranian newspaper reports he has been sentenced to death, possibly by an Islamic Revolutionary Court, after being convicted of crimes including at least three murders, various armed robberies, drug-related offences and cooperating with groups abroad which advocate the overthrow of the present government. The sentence is reported to have been confirmed by the Supreme Court. Vahid Ghadimi is said to have been sought by the authorities since escaping from prison in 1965 after conviction for robbery."
