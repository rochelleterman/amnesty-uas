 NA 
 On 12 June 1994 Luis Antonio Mendez, coordinator of the FLMN in the municipality of Zacacoyo, department of La Libertad, was killed by unidentified masked gunmen. On 10 June, both Monsignor Arturo Rivera y Damas, Archbishop of San Salvador, and the Auxiliary Bishop Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez received telephone death threats from a caller who identified himself as a member of the Comando Domingo Monterrosa, a death squad. These incidents have heightened fears for the safety of other opposition party members and members of the Catholic Church who have been outspoken in their condemnation of human rights violations in El Salvador."
