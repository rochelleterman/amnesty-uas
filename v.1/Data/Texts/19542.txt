 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of at   least three Mauritanian army officers  Lieutenant Colonel Saleh Ould Hananna
Lieutenant Mokhtar Ould Telli, Captain Yarbawho have      reportedly been arrested and are held incommunicado.

Lieutenant Colonel Saleh Ould Hananna, Lieutenant Mokhtar Ould Telli and Captain Yarba were reportedly arrested on  30 November. They have been transferred from army         barracks near the capital Nouakchott to an unknown        destination. Their arrest followed the discovery of       anti-government leaflets at the Nouakchott army barracks. The three officers are thought to have criticised the     diplomatic links established between the Mauritanian and  the Israeli governments. It appears that the three are    suspected of planning a coup."
