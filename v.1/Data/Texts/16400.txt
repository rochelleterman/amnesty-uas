 NA 
 Veljko Dzakula, a moderate Serbian politician from the Serbian occupied areas of Croatia (the Krajina) was reportedly arrested in the centre of Belgrade on 4 February 1994 by four men. Passers-by and a friend with him were prevented from assisting him by plainclothes policemen. Despite requests from lawyers and others on his behalf, the police have given no confirmation of his arrest or whereabouts. Veljko Dzakula was a prominent critic of the rebel Serb authorities and a proponent of reconciliation with Croatia."
