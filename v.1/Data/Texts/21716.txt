 NA 
 On 22 January 2008, the Supreme Court of Slovakia decided that extradition of Mustapha Labsi to Algeria is admissible. The Slovakian authorities are now preparing to forcibly return him, which would put him at serious risk of torture. Only the Minister of Justice now has the power to stop the extradition.  "
