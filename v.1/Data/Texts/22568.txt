 Qatari poet on trial: Mohammed al-Ajami | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Qatari poet Mohammed al-Ajami has been detained since November 2011 and is currently on trial for reportedly “inciting to overthrow the ruling regime” and “insulting the Amir” in relation to his poems. There are concerns that the charges may be solely in relation to the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression. If so, he would be considered a prisoner of conscience."
