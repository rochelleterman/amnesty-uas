 Mohamed Hedi Jouini, a carpenter and prisoner of conscience who has been on unlimited hunger strike since about 24 September 1996, discontinued his hunger strike at the end of November 1996. However the Court of Appeal has upheld his 1996 conviction to 3 and a half years' imprisonment. Amnesty International continues to call for his immediate and unconditional release as a prisoner of conscience.
