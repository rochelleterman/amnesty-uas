 Vicente Lpez P_rez and his sons Vicente Lpez Rodrguez and Mariano Lpez Rodrguez were allegedly tortured by Chiapas State police in December 2001. The police apparently threatened to beat them if they reported what had happened. Vicente Lpez P_rez has been released, and in April he reported the torture to the authorities. His sons are still in prison, and Amnesty International is concerned that they may suffer reprisals.
