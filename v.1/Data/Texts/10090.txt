 USA (Alabama): Further information on Death penalty / Legal concern: Thomas Douglas Arthur | Amnesty International 
 Thomas Arthur, aged 65, is now scheduled for execution on 6 December 2007 in Alabama. The state is pursuing his       execution despite what appears to be a moratorium on      executions in the USA pending the US Supreme Court's      examination of the constitutionality of lethal            injections. In addition, Alabama has not granted     Thomas   Arthur's request to be allowed to conduct DNA    testing of  evidence relating to the crime.
