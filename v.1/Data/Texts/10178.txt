 Those listed above were arbitrarily arrested between 13 and 15 March 1995. They are being held incommunicado at the main DISIP (Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services) branches in different states. There are fears that they may be tortured during interrogation in incommunicado detention. These are the latest arrests in a clampdown on political and student activists in recent days. They appear to be connected to a national day of protest called for 16 March 1995 in response to growing economic and social problems in Venezuela."
