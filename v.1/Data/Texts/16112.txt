 Adzhik Aliyev, an Islamic scholar, who has been sentenced to death in Tadzhikistan, was represented at his trial in the Supreme Court by a lawyer appointed by his family. There is therefore no further concern that his trial may have been unfair, because he was thought not to have been represented by a lawyer of his own choosing. "
