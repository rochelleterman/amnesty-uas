 UA 430/93 - Sudan: fear of torture: Osman Omar al-Sharif | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Osman Omar al-Sharif, a senior member of the banned Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), is reportedly being held for investigation in Sudan due to his alleged involvement in a one day strike by shopkeepers in Wad Medani on 27 November 1993. AI is concerned that he may have been arrested solely for his non-violent opposition to the government and may be at serious risk of being tortured in secret detention."
