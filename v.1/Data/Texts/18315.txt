 'Abdullah 'Abd al-Rahman al-Hudhayf, Ibrahim 'Abd al-Rahman al-Hudhayf, Dr Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Hudhayf, Dr Muhsin Hussain al-'Awaji, Naser Ibrahim al-Barak, 'Abd al-Rahman 'Ali al-Hudhayf, Salih Mansur al-Barak, Khalid 'Abdallah Salih al-Yahya, Sultan 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Suwaylem, Sultan 'Abd al-Muhsin al-Khamis: 'Abdullah 'Abd al-Rahman al-Hudhayf was executed on 12 August 1995. It is said he was sentenced to death after being found guilty of an attack on a security officer and of having links with the leaders of the banned Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights (CDLR). He had originally been sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. He had been denied access to lawyers since his arrest. Nine other political prisoners were sentenced to long prison terms. One of them, Ibrahim 'Abd al-Rahman al-Hudhayf, has been sentenced to 300 lashes in addition to 18 years' imprisonment. It is believed some of them may have been punished for their political dissent rather than the criminal charge of injuries caused to the security officer and may be prisoners of conscience. There are believed to be about 200 political prisoners still in detention, most detained incommunicado without charge or trial."
