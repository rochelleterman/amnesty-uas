 Sri Lanka: deliberate and arbitrary killings / fear of further killings: 42 villagers of Kallarawa, Trincomalee | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 During the night of 25/26 May 1995, members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) killed at least 42 Sinhalese civilians at Kallarawa, a small fishing hamlet 20 miles north of Trincomalee. Among those killed are at least 12 women and six children. There are fears that the massacre may mark the beginning of renewed LTTE attacks against unarmed civilians. This concern is heightened by reports that on 26 May LTTE members killed a Buddhist priest in Dimbulagala, Polonnarua District."
