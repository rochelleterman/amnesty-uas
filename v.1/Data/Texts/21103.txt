 Thirteen women representatives from the Boeung Kak Lake community in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, have been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison after a summary trial. The women were arrested on 22 May during a peaceful protest to support 18 local families whose homes had been destroyed in forced evictions."
