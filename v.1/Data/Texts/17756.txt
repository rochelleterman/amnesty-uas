 Israel: Fear for safety / Excessive use of force / Land Rights | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of Palestinian villagers and Israeli peace activists in the West Bank village of Bil'in. Israeli forces are increasingly using excessive force against them as they demonstrate peacefully every week against the construction of the fence/wall which is cutting them off from most of their land and depriving them of their livelihood.
