 Fifty-eight people from Colotenango, Huehuetenango department, have received death threats from members of the Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil (PAC), Civil Defence Patrols. They have taken refuge in the office of the Coordinadora Nacional de Viudas de Guatemala (CONAVIGUA), National Coordinating Committee of Widows of Guatmela. According to reports, the majority are women and children, who have refused to go back until the government guarantees their safety and punishes those responsible for the attack on peaceful demonstrators in the village of El Naranjal, Colotenango, by PAC members on 3 August. Members of the PAC had apparently fired indiscriminately into the crowd, killing Juan Pablo Chanay, and wounding several others. "
