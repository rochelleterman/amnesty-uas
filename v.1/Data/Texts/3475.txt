 Democratic Republic of Congo: Further information on medical/legal concern / fear of torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has learnt that Odile Kalala,       Placide Mpoyi and Etienne Richard Mbaya were released     from detention without charge in July and August 1999.    The organization is growing increasingly concerned,       however, for the safety of Professor Alidor Muamba Ntita  and Raymond Kabala. Both men have been held incommunicado since they were arrested by soldiers on 12 May.
