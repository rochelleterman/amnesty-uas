 Since 17 November 1994 over 30 former police officers and members of the Independent Trade Union of former Police Officers, all of them ethnic Albanians, have been arrested in Kosovo province. Ramadan Ndrecaj, former chief of police in Suva Reka, arrested on 22 November, has been so severely ill-treated in Prizren police station that he has been hospitalized. There are fears that the others may also face torture or ill-treatment. There is no information about any charges against the detainees."
