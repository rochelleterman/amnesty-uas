 Human rights defender Aline Castellanos' home was broken  into and searched while on 28 April. The burglary         happened the day after a Judge issued a warrant for her   arrest. This is the third warrant that has been issued    for her arrest. The previous two warrants were annulled   by federal injunctions.  Lawyer Yesica Sænchez of the     Liga Mexicana para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos     (Mexican League for the Defence of Human Rights, LIMEDDH) also has an arrest warrant pending on evidence that       appears to be flawed.
