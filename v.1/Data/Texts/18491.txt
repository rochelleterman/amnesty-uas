 Syria : Fear of torture/incommunicado detention: 'Abd al-Rahman al-Musa | Amnesty International 
 Syrian national 'Abd al-Rahman al-Musa (m) aged 41 was arrested on 19 January upon arrival at Damascus Airport by Political Security officers and is reportedly now held incommunicado at the Political Security Detention Centre in Hama, western Syria, where he is at serious risk of torture. He had been forcibly returned from the USA after his asylum application was turned down, despite the risk of torture he faces due to his previous affiliation with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood (MB) organisation.
