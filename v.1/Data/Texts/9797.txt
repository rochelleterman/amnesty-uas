 USA (Texas): Death penalty / Legal concern: Lonnie Earl Johnson (m) | Amnesty International 
 Lonnie Johnson, black, aged 44,  is scheduled to be executed in Texas on 24 July. He was sentenced to death in 1994 for the murder of two white teenagers in 1990. He has consistently maintained that he acted in self-defence, and an appeal newly filed on his behalf alleges that the prosecution withheld evidence that supported his claim.
