 NA 
 Pudjo Prasetio, aged 68 and a prisoner of conscience, has spent over 25 years in prison. He is recently reported to have suffered a stroke, which has left him with very slurred speech, although his memory is said to be good. He was arrested on 2 November 1967, one of many thousands arrested for membership of the now banned Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), or for alleged involvement in, or support for a coup attempt in September 1965. The majority of those arrested were released in the late 1970s, but an estimated 50 remain in prison, seven of these prisoners are under sentence of death. Over the last few years, his health is believed to have deteriorated before his stroke, and it is unknown what provisions have been made for his medical care."
