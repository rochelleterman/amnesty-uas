 NA 
 On 28 February 1994 Kim Sam-sok was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment under the National Security Law and Kim Un-ju was released after being given a suspended sentence. They were tortured after their arrest by the Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) in September 1993 and forced to sign confessions which they later retracted. To Amnesty International's knowledge there has been no official investigation into their allegations of ill-treatment. Kim Sam-sok is a prisoner of conscience."
