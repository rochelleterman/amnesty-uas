 NA 
 At the end of November 1995 hundreds of foreign nationals, including refugees and asylum-seekers, were rounded up by police in several waves of arrests. Although many have now been released, some are still held reportedly and may be at risk of torture in police custody or forcible return to their countries of origin where they face the risk of serious human rights violations.  The arrests appear to have been arbitrary and it is not known whether any of the detainees have been taken to court or formally charged."
