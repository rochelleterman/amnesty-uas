 UA 190/93 - Peru: death penalty: new death penalty law imminent | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is deeply concerned that the scope of the death penalty in Peru may be extended in the forthcoming new constitution. The Comision de Constitucion approved an article recommending the death penalty for crimes of treason and terrorism on 10 June 1993. Under the present constitution capital punishment may be applied only for crimes of treason in times of war with a foreign power."
