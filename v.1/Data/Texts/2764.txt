 Sudan: Further information on Fear of torture / incommunicado detention / excessive use of force. | Amnesty International 
 Ammar Najm al-Din, Sami Yousef Ismail and two other students were released without charge after being held incommunicado by the security services. The testimonies of the released students show that the students who remain in detention are still at risk of torture by security forces. Ammar Najm al-Din is also at risk of being re-arrested and tortured again. Amnesty International has learnt that Tahir Bashiri apparently managed to escape before being arrested, but the security forces are reportedly still looking for him. There is no further information on the whereabouts of the other students who are currently being held incommunicado.
