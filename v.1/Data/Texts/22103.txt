 Iran: Fear of excessive use of force/torture | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Thousands of people, mainly supporters of presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi, who has challenged the announcement that current President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had won the 12 June presidential election have been demonstrating in the streets in Tehran and other cities. They are at risk of injury or death at the hands of the security forces. Amnesty International believes the security forces are likely to use excessive force if, as expected, there are further demonstrations, and that those arrested are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment.
