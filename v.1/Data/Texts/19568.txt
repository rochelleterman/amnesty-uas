 On 11 March 2007, about 50 activists were arrested in Zimbabwe after attempting to attend a prayer meeting in   defiance of a three-month ban imposed by the authorities. The activists, including leaders of the main opposition   party in Zimbabwe -- the Movement for Democratic Change   (MDC) -- were severely beaten during arrest and later     tortured while in police custody."
