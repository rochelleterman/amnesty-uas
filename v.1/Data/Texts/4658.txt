 AI is concerned for the safety of displaced people living the Albergue Campesino in Barrancabermeja after soldiers from a local military base made threats against them on 20 March 1994. The Albergue is a refuge centre set up by church bodies and non-governmental organizations to offer temporary shelter to people forced by political violence to flee their homes."
