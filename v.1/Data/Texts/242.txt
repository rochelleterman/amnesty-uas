 UA 260/94 - Burundi: Last chance to save Burundi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is calling on the international community to take urgent effective action to prevent a repeat of the human rights crisis in Rwanda from occurring in Burundi. Tension is mounting there after the extremist political party, the PALIPEHUTU, began broadcasting politically inflammatory messages. These radio broadcasts come in the wake of continuing political and ethnic killings by the security forces and other armed groups in the run-up to presidential elections on 12 July 1994."
