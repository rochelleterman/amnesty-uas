 Bahrain: Further information on fear of torture / legal concerns | Amnesty International 
 'Ali Ahmad Kadham al-Muttaqawi, Jassim Hassan Mansour al-Khayat, Hussein Ahmed al-Mudhifa, Hussein Yousif Ibrahim, 'Ali Ahmad Kazem 'Abd 'Ali, 'Abbas 'Ali Ahmad Habil and at least 28 others: AI has learned that 'Abbas 'Ali Ahmad Habil has been tried by the State Security Court and sentenced in two separate cases to a total of 13 years in jail. Reportedly, his trial began three months before his ""confession"" was broadcast on national television together with those of the above-mentioned five men. There is concern that the ""confessions"" may have been extracted under pressure, as a result of torture or ill-treatment. The men are being held in incommunicado detention.
