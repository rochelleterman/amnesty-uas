 Guatemala: Medical action: Execution by lethal injection | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Guatemalan government has legislated to permit execution by lethal injection. Several men under sentence of death have now exhausted their appeals and the first of such execution appears imminent. It is unclear who will carry out the execution with press reports speaking both of a ""medical team"" and of ""paramedics""."
