 Mexico: Fear for safety / prison conditions | Amnesty International 
 Eleazar Garcia Trujillo, Agapito Hernandez Esparza, Rolando Arredondo Alanis, Juan Hernandez Lopez, and scores of others: There is grave concern for the safety and medical condition of prisoners at the Centro de Readaptacion Social (CERESO), Social Readaptation Centre, a prison in Apodaco, state of Nuevo Leon, following the violent clampdown on 25 June 1997 of a prisoners' protest against human rights violations by the prison authorities. More than 100 prisoners were reportedly injured, some seriously, and while some have received emergency medical treatment, the majority have had no access to adequate medical care. The authorities have denied all access to the prisoners.
