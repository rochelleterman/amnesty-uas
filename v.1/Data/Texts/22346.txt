 'Ali Hassan al-Majid, one of three former senior officials in Saddam Hussein’s government currently in US military custody in Iraq, is in imminent danger of execution. Two other former senior members of Saddam Hussein’s administration, Sultan Hashim Ahmad al-Ta’i and Hussain Rashid al-Tikriti, were sentenced to death at the same time as ‘Ali Hassan al-Majid, but as yet their death sentences have not been approved by the Presidential Council."
