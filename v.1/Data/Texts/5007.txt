 Raquel Judith Bernal Duenas, a former political activist with the party Union Patriotica, and her brother Jorge Ernesto, a teacher and trade unionist, have reportedly been receiving anonymous threatening telephone calls and have been followed and harassed by individuals who appear to be state security agents. This harassment has reportedly increased in recent days. Their sister, Gloria Esther Bernal Duenas, was reportedly detained, tortured and later ""disappeared"" by members of the National Police on 7 January 1988 in Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca department.
