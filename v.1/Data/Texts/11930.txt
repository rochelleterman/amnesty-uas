 UA 143/94 - Cambodia: arbitrary killings / fear for safety: Ethnic Vietnamese villagers in Kandal Province | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is gravely concerned by the killing of 13 ethnic Vietnamese civilians, including 9 children, in a attack on Piem So village on 9 April 1994. The attack follows a pattern of violence against ethnic Vietnamese Cambodians in 1993 by Khmer Rouge forces. Although the killings have been condemned by the government, AI fears for the safety of ethnic Vietnamese communities; the new constitution affords human rights guarantees only to people of Khmer (Cambodian) origin."
