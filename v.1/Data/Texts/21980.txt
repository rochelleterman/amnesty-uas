According to a report on 24 September  in the Persian language daily Iran, Dariush, Mehdi and    Javad, Iranians resident in Hamburg, Germany, were each   sentenced to 64 lashes and ordered to pay a fine of 10    million Iranian Rials (US$1250) in damages, after         reportedly filming women in central Tehran as part of     documentary on social life in Iran."
