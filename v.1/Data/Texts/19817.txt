 Rural leaders and farmers in a remote area of Amazonas state, northern Brazil, are facing death threats and attacks from illegal loggers and land-grabbers (grileiros) encroaching upon their lands. There remains no police presence in the area and no investigations into the illegal activities reportedly taking place. Those living in the region are in danger.  "
