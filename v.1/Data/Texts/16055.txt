 Armed people have reportedly threatened to attack Uzbekistani refugees in the Besh-Kana camp if they do not return to Uzbekistan. The refugees, who are seeking international protection in Kyrgyzstan, have told Amnesty International that they fear they will be tortured if they are forced to return. They fled the city of Andizhan in neighbouring Uzbekistan after government troops reportedly fired on thousands of mainly unarmed and peaceful demonstrators on 13 May.
