 USA/Egypt: Further Information on Fear of torture/ill-treatment/Health concern, Sami al-Laithi (m) | Amnesty International 
 Egyptian national Sami al-Laithi was returned to Egypt over the weekend of 1-2 October. He is feared to be at grave risk of torture, ill-treatment, unfair trial and other serious human rights violations. Amnesty International does not know what, if any, assurances the US authorities had obtained from the Egyptian authorities about how he would be treated. The Egyptian authorities reportedly deny that he has been handed over to them.
