 Ten inmates of “Los Llanos” state prison, in San Cristobal de las Casas, in the southern state of Chiapas, have been attacked and severely beaten by other prisoners, reportedly with the consent of the prison authorities. According to a local human rights organization, the attack was in reprisal for the prisoners' complaints of ill-treatment and corruption in the prison. They have not been given medical attention and may be at risk of further attacks."
