 UA 28/93 - Colombia: fear of ""disappearance"": Eduard Hurtado, Jairo Mantilla | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Eduard Hurtado and Jairo Mantilla were detained on 29 January 1993 in Barrancabermeja. A witness has reported seeing Eduard Hurtado being taken by soldiers from the military base in the Boston area in the northeastern area of Barrancabermeja on 31 January 1993. The provincial procurator and a municipal councillor of Barrancabermeja tried to look for the men at the army base on 31 January but were denied access to some of its installations. Their detention has been denied by the military authorities and there are fears for the men's safety. Jairo Mantilla's brother, a municipal councillor, had been involved in a meeting on 27 January to discuss the reopening of a shelter for people fleeing areas where the military are engaged in counter-insurgency operations.
