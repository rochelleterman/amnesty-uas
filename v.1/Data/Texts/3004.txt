 Sudan: Fear for safety/ Fear of torture/ Incommunicado detention | Amnesty International 
 The four men named above were arrested in Darfur, western Sudan on 20 and 21 December. They are detained incommunicado and Amnesty International fears that they may be tortured. In response to the deteriorating situation in Darfur, where the government forces are fighting with armed opposition groups, the Sudanese security forces have this year detained many members of settled ethnic groups such as the Fur, Zaghawa and Masalit, whom they suspect of supporting the armed opposition.
