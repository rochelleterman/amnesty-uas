 In a letter of 15 March 1994 from the International Secretariat of the LTTE in London, it was confirmed that 16 government soldiers were taken prisoner at Pooneryn in November 1993 and that their names will be provided to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The letter also refers to the release of Ranjith Gunasekera, and two policemen who had been held since June 1990. In an interview with the two released policemen published in the Daily News, Colombo, of 26 February, it is claimed that they had been held at the same detention camp as 30 other policemen, 26 army personnel and three fishermen. There is, therefore, concern at a discrepancy between the number held and the 50 visited by the ICRC delegation on 23 January 1994."
