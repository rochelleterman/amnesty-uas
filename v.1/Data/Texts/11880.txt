 Indonesia (East Timor): Further information on fear for safety: The population   of East Timor

 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International remains concerned for the security  of the entire population of East Timor, despite the       Indonesian authorities' recent decision to accept a       United Nations international peace-keeping force in the   territory.  Independence supporters remain at high risk   of attack by the Indonesian National Army (TNI) and/or    militia groups. Nuns and priests appear to be             particularly vulnerable, as are the thousands that remain internally displaced.
