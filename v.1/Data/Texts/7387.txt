 Mexico: Prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Two environmental activists, Isidro Baldenegro and Hermenegildo Rivas, have spent over a year in a federal prison in the State of Chihuahua, despite the recent prosecution of seven members of the state judicial police for fabricating evidence against them. Amnesty International is calling on Mexico's Attorney General (Procurador General de la Repœblica) to immediately drop the charges against the two men and secure their unconditional release as prisoners of conscience. A court verdict on their case is believed to be imminent.
