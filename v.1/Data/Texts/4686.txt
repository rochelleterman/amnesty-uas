 There is concern for the safety of the Zenu Indian community after three of its leaders and their driver were killed by unidentified gunmen on 26 March 1994, near the town of San Andres de Sotavento, Cordoba department. On 27 March their bodies were found near the town of Chinu, reportedly showing evidence of gunshot wounds and torture. Porfirio Ayala was Deputy Secretary of the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia, ONIC, and Luis Arturo Lucas was its former Secretary General. Hector Aquiles Malo was the indigenous leader of the main Zenu reservation of San Andres de Sotavento and deputy to the indigenous Senator, Gabriel Muyuy. The killings may be related to a long-running land dispute between local landowners and the Zenu Indians."
