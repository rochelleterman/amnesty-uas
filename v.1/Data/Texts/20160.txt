 NA 
 Reports indicate that at least five people have been killed in the political turmoil in Honduras since 21 September 2009, when deposed President Manuel Zelaya returned to the country. Mass demonstrations against the de facto authorities have taken place in various cities across Honduras, and there are reports of many demonstrators having been beaten and some shot by security forces, and of wide-scale arbitrary detentions."
