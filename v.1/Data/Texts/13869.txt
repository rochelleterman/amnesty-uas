 Amnesty International is concerned that Muhammad ?Abd al-Rahman Bilasi-Ashri is at imminent risk of being forcibly returned to Egypt by the Austrian authorities, possibly as early as today. If returned he would be at serious risk of torture and other human rights violations, which he has reportedly suffered in the past.
