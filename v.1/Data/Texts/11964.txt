 The six villagers named above from Prek Dam commune, Ponhea Lu district, Kandal province, were killed on 5 September 1994. Four of those who died were ethnic Vietnamese, the other two were ethnic Khmer people. According to witnesses several men in military uniforms arrived at the village demanding gold. When told there was no gold, they started shooting. The attackers were dressed in both Royal Cambodian Armed forces uniforms and Khmer Rouge uniforms. It is not known which of the two were responsible for the attack, but there are fears that further villages may be at risk unless the government undertakes to halt such attacks and provides protection to its ethnic Vietnamese communities."
