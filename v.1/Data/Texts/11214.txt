 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of      Gulsham Bano, her mother Raja Begum and father Muhammed   Shafi Wani, and their family, who have reportedly been    continually harassed by members of the ADA-322 battalion  of the Indian army since 19 March 1999, when Gulsham Bano and her mother lodged a complaint that they had been      raped by members of the battalion. On 31 May Gulsham Bano and her father were detained for several hours and        reportedly threatened with false charges by members of    the battalion, in an attempt to force the women to drop   the complaint.
