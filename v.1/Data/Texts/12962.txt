 Pakistan: Further information on possible prisoner of conscience / disregard for pre-trial legal safeguards: Humayun Fur, journalist | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has learned that Humayn Far's wife and children met him in the office of the Superintendent of police. There remains concern for his safety in detention, and that he may possibly be a prisoner of conscience detained solely for his professional activities as a journalist.
