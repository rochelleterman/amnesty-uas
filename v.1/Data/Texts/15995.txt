 There remains concern for the health of the four above-named defendants amid reports that they are not being granted appropriate medical care. Zaza Tsiklauri is reportedly suffering from a fever caused by tuberculosis, but his request to be transferred from the stuffy and crowded pre-trial detention cells has not been granted. Zurab Bardzimashvili is reportedly suffering from epilepsy, irregular breathing and a weak pulse, but has recently been returned to his cell from the hospital. Mamuka Daniel is reported to have been suffering from a high temperature for the last two weeks, but has not been transferred to hospital. A criminal investigation has been initiated into reports that Viktor Domukhovsky was beaten in his cell on 13 August by special police forces."
