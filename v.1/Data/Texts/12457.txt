 Dev Bahadur Maharjan was released from Sundarijal detention centre, near Kathmandu, on 7 January. However, security forces personnel began looking for him again a few minutes after his release, and he is now in hiding. Amnesty International is concerned that he may be rearrested, and he is at risk of ""disappearance"" or torture in detention.
