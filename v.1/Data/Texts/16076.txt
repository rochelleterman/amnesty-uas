 On 9 December 1993 the Supreme Court of the self-proclaimed Dnestr-Moldovan Republic (DMR) sentenced Ilie Ilascu to death and his five co-defendants to prison terms ranging from two to 15 years. The six had been accused of terrorist acts. AI is concerned that the six men may not have received a fair trial and were reportedly sentenced without right of appeal. AI is also concerned about reports suggesting that some were initially denied a defence lawyer and beaten or otherwise ill-treated to exact confessions. All but Vladimir Garbuz pleaded not guilty and withdrew any confessions on the grounds that they had been made under duress."
