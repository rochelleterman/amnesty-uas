 NA 
 On 25 January 2011, the Pennsylvania Superior Court will hear oral arguments in its review of Jordan Brown’s appeal against a court decision to try him as an adult for the killing of Kenzie Houk, his father’s fiancée. If tried in an adult court, the 13-year-old boy could be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. This sentence, when imposed on anyone who was under 18 years old at the time of the crime, violates international law."
