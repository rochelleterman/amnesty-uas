 Peru: Death Threats/Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Gloria Cano, a lawyer for the human rights organization Asociaci—n Pro Derechos Humanos (APRODEH), Association for the Defence of Human Rights, has recently received death threats. The threats appear to be linked to her work on behalf of the families of three members of the armed opposition group Movimiento Revolucionario Tœpac Amaru (MRTA). These three members were reportedly extrajudicially executed during a military operation to rescue 72 civilians taken hostage in the residence of the Japanese Ambassador in 1997, under the government of former president Alberto Fujimori. It is the latest in a series of acts of intimidation against APRODEH.
