 Further information on EXTRA 04/94 (EUR 44/05/94, 21 January) - Turkey: fear of torture / health concern: Ahmet Aygun, and new names: Mehmet Incesu, Hakki Incesu, Suleyman Arslan | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International has received the names of three other people taken into custody, apparently in the same operation in which Ahmet Aygun was detained. Mehmet Incesu was detained with his uncle Hakki Incesu on 19 January in the Eminonu district of Istanbul. Suleyman Arslan was detained the same day in a different part of the city. They are being held incommunicado. The State Security Court prosecutor gave permission for lawyers to see Ahmet Aygun, but the lawyers were denied access at the police station. Although police admit to holding Hakki Incesu, they have denied that Mehmet Incesu is in their custody."
