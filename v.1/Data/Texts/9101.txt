 USA (Florida): death penalty: Raleigh Porter | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Raleigh Porter, white, is scheduled to be executed in Florida on 29 March 1995. He was sentenced to death in 1978 for two murders. Although the jury which tried him recommended life imprisonment, the presiding judge overruled this and pass a death sentence. This judge has overridden 132 recommendations for life sentence since 1974. Raleigh Porter reportedly suffered sexual and physical abuse as a child. In spite of this, a recent psychological evaluation described him as being intelligent and ""solid emotionally"". An application for clemency was submitted to the Governor of Florida on 25 January 1995 but the Governor refused to refer it the to clemency board, so it has not been considered. He also refused the defendant or his attorneys permission to present arguments to the board."
