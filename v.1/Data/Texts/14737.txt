 The 11 Kurds listed above were detained by police on 8 July in Istanbul and have since been held in unacknowledged incommunicado detention. There are fears they may be being subjected to torture, particularly since Nurcan Balci was transferred to Sisli Etfal Hospital on 10 July, reportedly suffering from a fractured knee cap and lower spine as a result of torture. There is also concern for Recep Marasli, publishing director of Komal Publishing House and a former prisoner of conscience. He has suffered from poor health since he was severely beaten following a hunger-strike at Diyarbakir Military Prison in 1984. He is once again considered to be a prisoner of conscience."
