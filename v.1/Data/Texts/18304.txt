 Saudi Arabia: Fear of ill-treatment / health concerns / possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of Farzana Kauzar, a Pakistani national and her children Mohamed Assad Ijaz, Fakeyha Ijaz and Mohamed Saad, who have been in secret detention or under restriction orders in Saudi Arabia for the previous eight months.  It is feared they may be at risk of ill-treatment and there is also concern that one of the children, Mohamed Saad, is suffering ill-health. It is thought they are being held as hostages to force the children's father to return to Saudi Arabia for questioning in relation to a business dispute.
