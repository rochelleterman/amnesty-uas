 AI has had reports of the detention and harassment of trade unionists in Khartoum and other northern Sudanese cities in advance of elections to trade union councils scheduled for the end of September 1992. Those named above are reportedly in secret detention in Khartoum, probably in one of the ""ghost houses"" (secret detention centres) run by the government security service. AI fears that they may be tortured. Large numbers of other trade unionists have reportedly been detained for brief periods and many are said to be obliged to report daily to security headquarters in Khartoum. "
