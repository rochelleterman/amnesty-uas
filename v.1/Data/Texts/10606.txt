 A group of Tibetans who were detained in September 2006,  when they were trying to flee from China to Nepal were    tortured in custody. According to members of the group    who were released, the older teenagers and adults were    beaten with rubber batons and electric-shock prods. The   younger children were not beaten, but were interrogated.  It is not clear if all those who were detained have been  released or if some still remain in custody.
