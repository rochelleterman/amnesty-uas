 EXTRA 17/94 - USA (Maryland): death penalty: John Frederick Thanos | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 John Thanos, white, received three death sentences in 1992 for murder. He is scheduled to be executed in Maryland during the week beginning 25 April 1994. He has stated that he wishes to abandon legal appeals and has asked to be executed. However, his mother and sister have filed an appeal on his behalf, claiming that he is incompetent to wave his right to appeal. The appeal claims that he has a history of mental illness and suicidal behaviour. None of the evidence relating to his mental health has yet been heard in a court of law."
