 AI has received reports that Valizhon Akhmedzhanov may have ""disappeared"" from death row in Uzbkistan. It was assumed that his petion for clemency had been turned down by the President and that he had been executed but unofficial sources state that he is alive and has been transferred from death row in Taskent to an unknown place of detention in or around Bukhara and that he is being used for forced labour."
