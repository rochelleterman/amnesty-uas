 There continues to be serious concern for the safety of members of the Movement for Civic-Community Integration of Pailitas, department of Cesar, following threats against Miguel Enrique Olaya Pabon. At about 10pm on 11 May 1995 he was reportedly talking with a friend on a bench in El Jardin park opposite his home in Pailitas, when four men dressed in civilian clothes and berets surrounded them. He recognized one of the men as a civilian army informer with Operational Command No 7; the other three were identified as soldiers. A local resident intervened and was threatened with a revolver. All three men managed to escape when another resident came out of her house. Miguel Enrique had reportedly been warned that his name appeared on a ""black list"" drawn up by the army. His name apparently appeared on the list because of his work with the Municipal Committee for Human Rights."
