 Chile: Fear of total impunity / legal concern: armed forces petition to end legal proceedings on human rights violations | Amnesty International 
 On 4 October 1996, the Military Prosecutor General petitioned the Supreme Court of Justice to instruct all appeal courts and judges to proceed with the definite closure of the legal proceedings into cases of human rights violations from the initial period of military government. This petition covers all cases of ""disappearances"" and extrajudicial executions which ocurred between 1973 and 1978 and would imply an extension of the Amnesty Law of April 1978.
