 Tunisia: Further information on fear of torture or ill-treatment / prisoner of conscience: Abdel Moumen Belanes | Amnesty International 
 Prisoner of conscience Abdel Moumen Belanes stopped his hunger-strike on 11 April 1997. He had been on hunger-strike since 17 March in protest at his imprisonment and at the poor conditions of detention. He was sentenced to one year's imprisonment on 8 April 1997 on charges of disturbing public order. He has been moved from 9 Avril Prison in Tunis to Nadhor Prison, apparently as a punishment for his hunger-strike.
