 Syria: Fear of torture / prisoner of conscience / health concern: Munif Mulhim | Amnesty International 
 Long-term prisoner of conscience Munif Mulhim, who was due for release in mid-1996, is feared to have been transferred back to Tadmur Military Prison, where conditions are harsh and there is routine torture and ill-treatment. There is further concern at reports that he is in poor health. He is reported to have refused to sign a statement, as a condition of his release, promising to dissociate himself from all past political activities and expressing support for the present regime. Amnesty International is continuing to call for his immediate and unconditional release.
