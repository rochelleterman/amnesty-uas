 NA 
 Miguel Bru, a 23-year-old student of journalism, has been reported missing since 17 August 1993. His ""disappearance"" has been linked to a complaint he filed against members of La Plata 9th Police Station, relating to a raid on his house on 13 April by police without a search warrant. In the raid he and another lodger were threatened with a firearm. A police investigation was initiated into his ""disappearance"", but the judge in charge has reportedly stated that the investigation is exhausted. "
