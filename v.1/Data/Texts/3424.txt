 Zaire: Further information on fear of mass human rights violations: members of the Tutsi ethnic group and other civilians | Amnesty International 
 A number of Tutsi civilians are reported to have been arrested, apparently arbitrarily, on 22 October 1996 in Goma, the capital of North-Kivu region. Sources in Goma also indicate that Tutsi civilians have been heading towards the border with Rwanda, apparently in order to escape from such arrests or other human rights violations.
