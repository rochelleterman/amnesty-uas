 On 5 July 1996 seven heavily armed men raided the home of the above, a 30-year-old journalist. They forced everyone in the house to lie face down on the floor and demanded to know which of them was Fabiola Cancino de los Santos. When she made herself known they warned her: ""If you continue to do this reporting we will kill you"". They also threatened members of her family and some friends, including a two-year-old girl.
