 People's Republic of China: ill-treatment / prisoner of conscience: Tong Yi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The US-based group, Human Rights in China, has reported that Tong Yi, assistant to leading dissident Wei Jingsheng, has been repeatedly beaten in the Hewan Labour Camp. The report claims that she was beaten by camp ""trustees"" (inmates who supervise other prisoners) on 16 January 1995. The beating came soon after she had complained to the labour camp authorities about the long hours of work at the camp, which apparently breach state regulations on the hours worked by prisoners. Tong Yi also complained about the beating but no action was taken against the perpetrators; indeed, she received another beating. AI is concerned about these allegations of ill-treatment and continues to call for Tong Yi, a prisoner of conscience, to be released."
