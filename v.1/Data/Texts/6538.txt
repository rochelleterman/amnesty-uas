 Guatemala: Death threats and intimidation | Amnesty International 
 Lawyer Romeo Monterrosa Orellana and his family (wife and two daughters, aged 10 and 11) have received a string of death threats, and suffered intimidation, believed to be linked to his work defending peasant farmers against powerful landowners. Amnesty International believes they are in grave danger. Romeo Monterrosa is representing the human rights NGO Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo (GAM), as party to the state prosecution proceedings, in charging the owner of the El Corozo farm with the murder of eight farm workers who were shot dead during protests against the land owner on 24 January 2005.
