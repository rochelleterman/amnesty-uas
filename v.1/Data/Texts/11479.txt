 Seven East Timorese asylum seekers who entered the embassies of Finland and Sweden in Jakarta on 23 June 1993 are at serious risk as long as they remain in Indonesia or East Timor. Amnesty International is calling on the Governments of Finland and Sweden to take immediate steps to facilitate their departure from Indonesia. Some of the 7 were arbitarily arrested, beaten and tortured following demonstrations during and after the visit to East Timor of Pope John Paul II in 1989 and by the Ambassador of the USA in 1990. Three of the seven were shot and wounded during the Santa Cruz massacre of 12 November 1991. On 24 June the four who had sought refuge in the Finnish embassy left the premises after doubtful assurances were given by the military that their rights would be protected. "
