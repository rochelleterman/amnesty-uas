 Guatemala: Death penalty / legal concern | Amnesty International 
 Miguel Angel Revolorio Rodriguez, Miguel Angel Lopez Calo, Anibal Archila Perez: The three former police officers named above were sentenced to death in May 1996 for murder and attempted murder. Their appeals were turned down by the Constitutional Court on 18 June 1997 and there is concern that their executions may be imminent. There is further concern at allegations that proceedings against them contained irregularities which violated their right to a fair trial.
