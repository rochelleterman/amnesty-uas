 AI has learned that the Sukhdev Singh and Harjinder Singh are to be executed at 4am (local time) on 9 October 1992 in Pune, Maharashtra. The Supreme court has rejected another petition brought on their behalf. A petition has now been filed requesting commutation or retrial on the technical ground that their conviction, initiated under the special procedures of TADA legislation, did not allow a two stage appeal.
