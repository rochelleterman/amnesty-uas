 UA 423/93 - Rwanda: fear of extrajudicial execution: Alphonse-Marie Nkubito | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 14 November 1993 unidentified men threw grenades at Alphonse-Marie Nkubito as he entered his home in the Kacyiru suburb of Kigali. Unofficial sources have alleged that the perpetrators are members of the security forces acting clandestinely. Following rumours that he would be assassinated while recovering in hospital, he has now gone into hiding in fear for his life. Alphonse-Marie Nkubito is the Attorney General, Kigali Court of Appeal, and president of a non-governmental human rights group, the Association rwandaise pour les droits de l'homme (ARDHO). These attacks occurred a few days before he was due to prosecute a businessman known to have close links with top government officials and members of the security forces."
