 Mexico: ""Disappearance"" / fear of torture / possible prisoner of conscience: Ignacio Fernando Nino Garcia | Amnesty International 
 There is concern for the safety of Prof. Ignacio Fernando Nino Garcia, a human rights activist and teacher, who has not been since his reported arrest during a peaceful demonstration on 21 March 1997. Approximately 50 local human rights activists were participating in a peaceful protest in the town of San Augustin Loxicha, state of Guerrero. They were demanding the release of Loxicha indigenous people arbitrarily detained last year. The demonstration was reportedly violently broken up by members of the state police. Some of the protesters, including Juliana Gonzalez Roque, Alejandro Sandoval Samperio, Gerardo Pulido Sandoval and Bertha Ramirez Ramirez were seriously injured during the attack.
