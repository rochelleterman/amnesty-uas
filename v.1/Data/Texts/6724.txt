 Haiti: Further information on arbitrary arrest/ prisoner  of conscience / medical concern: GÃ©rard Jean Juste (m) | Amnesty International 
 G‰rard Jean Juste (Catholic priest), who is reportedly suffering from leukaemia, was granted a provisional release from detention on health grounds on 29 January. The interim government in Haiti apparently granted his release to allow him to seek treatment abroad, as there are no medical facilities in Haiti able to offer treatment for leukaemia. Father Jean Juste has been allowed to travel to Miami, USA, where he will be treated.
