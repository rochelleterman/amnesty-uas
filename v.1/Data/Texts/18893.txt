 On 26 May 1993 41 people were sentenced to death by the special court in Algiers in two separate trials, in connection with terrorist attacks, including the bombing of Algiers airport on 26 August 1992 and the planting of a bomb in the television station in June 1992. Following the airport bombing six people were arrested and their confessions shown on Algerian television. There were allegations that the confessions had been extracted under torture. The men have no right of appeal, but may seek a review by ""cassation"" by the Supreme Court. However ""cassation"" rules only on procedures and does not reexamine facts, thus failing to safeguard the detainees' right of appeal. "
