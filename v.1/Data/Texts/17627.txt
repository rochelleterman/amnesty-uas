 Ahmad Ibrahim Sa'id, from Nablus on the West Bank and a student at Bir Zeit University, was arrested on 29 June 1994 and later charged with activities on behalf of Hamas. AI wrote to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in August 1994, expressing concern about reports that he had been tortured. He remains in Ashkelon prison. Ahmad Sa'id's interrogation apparently resumed on 20 September. According to his lawyer, he is again being ill-treated and threatened by his interrogators. AI is concerned about his safety in detention."
