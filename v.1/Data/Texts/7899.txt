 UA 109/94 - Peru: arbitrary detention / fear of unfair trial: Santosa Layme Bejar | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 According to reports Santosa Layme Bejar, a community activist, was arbitrarily detained on 26 February 1994 by members of the anti-terrorist police, DINCOTE. It is thought she is suspected of having links to an armed opposition group, although Amnesty International does not believe she has any such involvement. Reportedly she has consistently made public her unqualified opposition to the activities of the armed opposition. There is concern she is being held under anti-terrorism legislation which falls short of international fair trial standards."
