 Sri Lanka: Sri Lankan activists threatened | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 2 March, a Sri Lankan news website, Lankanewsweb, published the names of human rights defenders and journalists featured on a list it alleged was compiled by a Sri Lankan intelligence unit. Amnesty International fears that the list was leaked to the press as part of a government campaign to intimidate those named on it, and stop them from speaking out against the authorities. Two male human rights defenders, Dr Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu and J. C. Weliamuna, are at particular risk.  "
