 On 16 August 1995, 16 people were sentenced to death by the Beijing Municipal First Intermediate Court. The six men named above were taken for execution immediately after being sentenced to death, apparently without being granted the right to appeal. There are fears that the remaining ten face imminent execution in a continuing ""anti-crime campaign"" in Beijing in the lead up to the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women."
