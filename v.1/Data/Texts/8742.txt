 USA (California): Insane man due to be executed: Horace Kelly, black | Amnesty International 
 Despite overwhelming evidence that Horace Kelly is insane and does not understand that he could be about to die, his execution remains scheduled for 14 April 1998. If carried out, his execution would constitute a clear violation of both the US Constitution and international standards.
