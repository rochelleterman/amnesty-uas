 Indonesia: Use of excessive force / fear for safety: Indonesian Democratic Party demonstrators in Jakarta | Amnesty International 
 Dozens of people are reported to have been injured when security forces charged on demonstrators during a march by members of the opposition Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) in Jakarta on 20 June 1996. One unconfirmed report said that a demonstrator had been killed. Further rallies by the PDI are planned for the next few days, raising serious fears for the safety of demonstrators. The march was organized by PDI members loyal to the party chairwoman Megawati Sukarnoputri in protest against a three-day congress of dissident party members being held in Medan, North Sumatra.
