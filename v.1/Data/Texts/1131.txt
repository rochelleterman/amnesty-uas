 UA 270/94 - Kenya: torture / fear of torture: Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki, Anthony Njuguna Njui, John Kinyanjui and his cousin (name unknown), Jimmy James Waigwa | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki is reported to have been severely tortured and his lawyers are currently filing a habeas corpus application in the High Court because there are fears for his life. There are fears also for the others listed above who are also being held in incommunicado police custody in Nakuru. None of the detainees have been brought to court or charged. They were all arrested during the weekend of 9/10 July 1994. There is concern that they may have been targeted because of their political and human rights activity. Jimmy James Waigwa may have been arrested as a result of proceedings he brought against a senior police superintendent. There are also unconfirmed reports that he may have been released on 14 July. Anthony Njuguna Njui is one of the principle defence witnesses in the case of Koigi wa Wamwere."
