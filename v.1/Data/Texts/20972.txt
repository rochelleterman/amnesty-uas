 Huang Qi, a human rights activist based in the southwestern city of Chengdu, was detained by plainclothed police officers on 10 June. He is held on suspicion of “illegally acquiring state secrets”. No one has been able to visit him in detention, and Amnesty International believes he is at risk of torture and ill-treatment."
