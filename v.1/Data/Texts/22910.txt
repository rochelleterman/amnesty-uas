 Medical Action: Algeria:  Fears for imprisoned doctor and human rights activist

 | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 29 September 2003, Algerian doctor and human rights    activist, Salaheddine Sidhoum, who had been living in     hiding for nine years, presented himself to the public    prosecutor in Algiers, apparently because of his wish to  return to a normal life. Sidhoum began a hunger strike on the same day to claim certain rights - such as to be able to receive books and newspapers - and to demand a fair    trial."
