 Malaysia: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/incommunicado detention/possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Eight men, arrested between 2 and 3 August 2001 under the Internal Security Act (ISA), are being held incommunicado at unknown locations. They are at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Amnesty International believes they may be prisoners of conscience, detained purely for exercising their right to engage in peaceful dissenting political activities.
