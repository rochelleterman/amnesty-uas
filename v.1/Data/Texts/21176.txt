 Pakistan: Further information: Human rights lawyer still at risk: Asma Jahangir | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Leading human rights lawyer Asma Jahangir remains at risk despite the provision of security provided by Pakistan authorities. The authorities appear unable or unwilling to investigate Asma Jahangir claims that Pakistan’s security forces were behind the plot. Deaths of human rights activists have increased over the last year, many of which implicate the military’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency."
