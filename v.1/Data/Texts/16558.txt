 NA 
 There are fears that al-Shaikh 'Ali Salman, Ibrahim Hassan and an unknown number of others arrested during the past week are at risk of torture in detention. The arrests allegedly took place after many Bahraini nationals had signed a petition calling on the Amir of Bahrain to reinstate parliament. One of those arrested, Ahmed Hassan, was released after a few days, but had reportedly been beaten. Most of those arrested are believed to be held in al-Qal'a prison."
