 Rosa del Pilar de Pastor, wife of army general Jose Pastor Vives who is at present in prison because of his alleged involvement in a failed military coup on 13 November 1992, has reportedly received anonymous death threats. She has stated that on two occasions she has received anonymous threats telling her to abandon her home immediately because explosives had been placed there. She apparently believes that these threats are a consequence of her campaigning on behalf of here detained husband. "
