 Israel/Occupied Territories: House Demolition/forced eviction
 | Amnesty International 
 In April, the Israeli army served demolition orders on    all the residents of the Palestinian Bedouin village of Hadidiya, in the Jordan Valley in the east of the occupied West Bank. The inhabitants of the village expect the tents and shacks where they live to be demolished any time. After previous demolitions they have pitched tents  again in the village but now they face being forcibly     removed from the land where they have lived for decades.
