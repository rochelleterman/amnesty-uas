 Iraq: Bring justice to thousands still illegally detained in Iraq | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Thousands of men, women and children are still held       without charge or trial in detention facilities in Iraq,  including Abu Ghraib, after the official end of the       occupation on 28 June 2004. Some detainees are housed in  tents, and are suffering under the intense heat of Iraq's summer."
