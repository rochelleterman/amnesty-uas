 Abdulkerim Avsar was detained in Izmir on 20 February 1993 and subsequently transferred to Diyarbakir where he was interrogated in incommunicado detention until about 18 or 19 March 1993. He was then formally arrested and committed to prison. His family and lawyer are reportedly still being refused access to him, which is giving rise to grave concern for his well- being. "
