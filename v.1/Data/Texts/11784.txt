 T Jamaluddin, alias Bit; Muzarni and Adnan: The three men, arrested  by the military on 26 February 1998 and believed to have been held in incommunicado military detention have been transferred to police custody in Aceh Besar. Their risk of torture or ill-treatment is therefore significantly reduced.
