 On 29 July 1994 Carlos Alberto Ruiz, a researcher with the Latin American Institute for Alternative Legal Services, received a telephoned death threat against himself and his family. On 1 May his name had been given under torture to agents of the Judicial and Investigative Police by Luis Tellez. The next day Carlos Alberto Ruiz was reportedly followed and the offices of ILSA and another human rights organization were placed under surveillance. There is concern for his safety and that of other human rights activists."
