 At least 20 people are reported to have been killed by members of the Togolese Army following an alleged attack on an army barracks on 25 March 1993. The victims are mainly military personnel. Dozens of military personnel are reported to have been arrested because of suspected involvement in the attack on the army barracks or for suspected membership of the Association des militaires democrates, a secret military organization which advocates reform. One of those arrested, army musician Warrant Officer Lawson, was reportedly severely tortured and had to be admitted to hospital. "
