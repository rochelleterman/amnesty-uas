 The five Tamil farmers named above, from Cithandy Village in Batticaloa District, were reportedly arrested on 24 December 1993 near the Santhanamadu River, Kudavaddaikadu, by army personnel belonging to the Mullivedduvan army camp. Relatives have informed the Batticaloa Peace Committee and have made inquiries at the Pullipainjakal (Tiger Leaf Rock) army camp, where the five were believed to have been taken. The commanding officer at the camp denied that they were detained there. Their whereabouts remain unknown."
