 Cameroon: Further information on fear of torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Roger Alexis Wamba, Jules Armand Mbe, Blaise Ngoune Temgoua and two other students who were arrested and beaten by members of a vigilante group, auto-defense, are next due to appear in court on 23 May 1997, charged with inciting revolt against the government and the institutions of the Republic. The charges relate to violent confrontations between students and the security forces in May and June 1996 on the campus of the University of Yaounde 1. Amnesty International has since received a critical letter from the Rector of the University about the incident. There remains concern that there has been no investigation into the reports of their torture, and that they are not known to have been accused of individual responsibility for any act of violence.
