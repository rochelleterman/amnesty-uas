 There are fears for the safety of the above-named three young Tamil men, who were detained by the security forces in Colombo between 4 and 14 June 1995. Recent reports of people being abducted, killed in custody and their bodies disposed of secretly have heightened fears about their fate. Efforts to find out what has happened to them have not been successful. There have been continuing reports of arbitrary detentions of hundreds of Tamils since the resumption of hostilities in mid-April, especially in the east of the country and in the capital, Colombo."
