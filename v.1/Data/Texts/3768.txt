 Edmeia da Silva Euzebio and Sheila da Caonceicao were shot dead in Rio de Janeiro on 15 January 1993 in circumstances suggesting that they were extrajudicially executed. All those named above, except Sheila da Conceicao, are mothers of some of the 11 youths who ""disappeared"" in 1990; they have actively campaigned for an investigation into the fate of their ""disappeared"" children. The mothers have reported harassment by the military police and on 6 January 1993 Edmeia da Silva Euzebio allegedly denounced during a judicial inquiry the involvment of the police in the ""disappearance"" of the youths. The two women were shot by unidentified men who had been following them in a car. The men escaped after the killing. "
