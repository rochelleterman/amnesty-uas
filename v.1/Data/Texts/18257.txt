 Qatar: Fear for safety: Hamda Fahad Jassem Al-Thani (f)

 | Amnesty International 
 Hamda Fahad Jassem Ali Al-Thani, aged 28, a member of Qatar's ruling family, is being forcibly held at her family's home in the capital Doha. Her father's disapproval of her choice of husband has reportedly led to her being detained by members of the security forces for a year, and her current confinement to the family home. She is said to have been beaten by her family and is not allowed access to the outside world. Amnesty International is concerned for her safety.
