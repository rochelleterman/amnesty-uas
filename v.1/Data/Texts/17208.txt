 Iran: Death penalty/ fear of imminent execution: Reza Alinejad (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Reza Alinejad, aged 21, is at risk of imminent execution after being convicted of murder, despite his claims that he acted in self-defence. He was 17 years old at the time of the offence. Iran is a state party to international treaties which prohibit the execution of child offenders- those who were under the age of 18 at the time of their alleged offence.
