 Du Yimin, a businesswoman convicted of “fraudulent raising of public funds” was executed on 5 August after China’s Supreme People’s Court (SPC) approved her sentence. Du Yimin was sentenced to death in March 2008. Her appeal was rejected on 13 January 2009. Amnesty international believes Du Yimin did not receive a fair trial in line with international standards and condemns her execution."
