 On 22 March 1994 the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and death sentence on Chin Kim Lin for drug offences. The original date of sentence by the High Court is not known. He can now petition the State Pardons Board. On the same day the Supreme Court quashed the convictions of two other prisoners, and commuted that of a third to life imprisonment."
