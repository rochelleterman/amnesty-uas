 Nepal: Further Information on: Fear for safety/ possible ""disappearance"" : Govinda Ghimire | Amnesty International 
 Govinda Ghimire was freed on 24 August 2005 following a second Supreme Court ruling that his detention was illegal and that he should be released immediately. However, lawyers and human rights defenders recognized members of the security forces dressed in plain clothes waiting outside the Supreme Court building and feared that he could be re-arrested once again. Govinda Ghimire remained inside the court until representatives of Nepal's National Human Rights Commission arrived on the scene and escorted him to safety.
