 UA 290/93 - Peru: fear for safety / legal concern: Jose Barletti Pascuales (includes a correction) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Jose Barletti Pascuales, leader of the Sindicato Unico de la Educacion del Peru, SUTEP, the Peruvian teacher's union, was detained by the police in Iquitos, Loreto department, on 17 August 1993. When his wife went to the police station with a legal adviser to make inquiries about his arrest, the police initially denied his detention. However, by chance, the legal adviser saw Jose Barletti inside the station and the police were forced to admit to holding him. "
