 Mexico: Further information on Medical concerns/ fear for arbitrary detention/ forced evictions | Amnesty International 
 All those detained after being evicted on 18 August 2007 from their homes in the Montes Azules nature reserve in Chiapas state have now been released. However, the authorities have not provided them with alternative land, or offered to compensate them for the homes and belongings which were destroyed when they were forcibly evicted. In addition, the authorities are thought to be still planning to forcibly evict five other communities settled in the Montes Azules nature reserve.
