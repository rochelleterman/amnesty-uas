 Jordan: Further information on Death penalty/torture/unfair trial, Jamal Darwish Fatayer. | Amnesty International 
 Jamal Darwish Fatayer could be executed in the next few weeks. Amnesty International is extremely concerned that Jamal Darwish Fatayer's trial proceedings have fallen far short of international standards and at reports that he was tortured to ""confess"" while held in incommunicado detention by the General Intelligence Department (GID) in Amman, Jordan.
