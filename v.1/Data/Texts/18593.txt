 | Amnesty International 
 University students 'Ali Nazeer Mustafa and Husam 'Ali Mulhim have been held incommunicado without charge since they were arrested by Air Force Intelligence officers in the capital Damascus, on 26 January. They are at risk of torture or ill-treatment. The students were reportedly participants in peaceful pro-democracy discussions. Amnesty International considers them prisoners of conscience, held solely for their peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association.
