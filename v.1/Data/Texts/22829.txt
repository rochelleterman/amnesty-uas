 On 10 December, Human Rights Day, a Florida court         overturned the conviction of Lionel Tate. In 2001, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the 1999 murder of six-year-old Tiffany Eunick committed when Lionel Tate was 12 years old. The state    has until 25 December to appeal against the decision."
