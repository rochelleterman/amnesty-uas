 Colombia:  Fear for Safety / Possible ""Disappearance"" /   Killing of members of the Indigenous Embera-Kat√≠o         communities in Antioquia Department | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the      safety of the indigenous Embera-Kat’o communities in the  department of Antioquia who are being attacked by         paramilitary forces and armed opposition groups. Neither  side in the long-running armed conflict   accept the      community's right not to be drawn into the     conflict.  On 26 March 2000, community member Remigio      Bailar’n  was   reportedly abducted by paramilitaries               belonging to the    Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia       (AUC), United  Self Defence Groups of Colombia. His       whereabouts remain unknown and Amnesty International is   very concerned for   his safety.  On the 28 March the     body of 12-year-old Rub_n Dar’o Bailar’n was found in a   rural area between the towns of Frontino and Dabeiba in   northwest Antioquia. It appears he had been shot by       paramilitaries.
