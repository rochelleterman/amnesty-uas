 Yusuf Abdi Gabobe, the Haatuf (Messenger) publisher, was  sentenced on 4 March to two years' imprisonment for       obstruction of a police officer. The newspaper's editor,  Ali Abdi Dini, and journalist Mohamed Omar Sheikh         Ibrahim, were each sentenced to 29 months' imprisonment   for ""reporting false information about the government,    discrediting the president and his family and creating    inter-communal tension.""  Amnesty International considers them prisoners of conscience, detained solely for         exercising their right to freedom of expression.
