 Israel/Occupied territories: Further information on medical concern | Amnesty International 
 Shahir Mansur's lawyer has informed Amnesty International that, until today, the Mansur family has not been able to travel to the United States due to restrictions on travel imposed on the West Bank. Shahir Mansur needs to travel to hospital in the United States with his son Munjid, who urgently needs a life-saving liver transplant operation. The lawyer has now submitted a petition to the Israeli High Court of Justice for authorization for the family to travel.
