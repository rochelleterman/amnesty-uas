 AI is concerned about the executions of the three men named above, believed to have taken place on 25 and 26 March in detention centres in Osaka and Sendai. They are the first executions to have been carried out in over three years. The three men had been convicted of murder. Kawanaka Tetsuo's lawyer is reported to have said that his client was suffering from a mental disorder. AI fears that further executions may be imminent. "
