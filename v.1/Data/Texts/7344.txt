 Political activist David Venegas was arbitrarily detained by state police in central Oaxaca City on 13 April, and   reportedly tortured. He has been charged with serious     criminal offences, on the basis of evidence which appears to have been fabricated. He may be at risk of further     ill-treatment and unfair judicial proceedings. Human      rights lawyer Isaac Torres Carmonas was with him when he  was arrested, and the police reportedly threatened him.
