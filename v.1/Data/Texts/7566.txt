 Political activist Leoncio Luna Antonio was shot and killed on 7 November in the Zapotec indigenous community of Santa Cruz, in the Loxicha region of Oaxaca State. He was the fifth Zapotec person killed in political violence in 2004: the state authorities have failed to protect indigenous communities, or bring those responsible for the violence to justice. Opposition political activists, and people working for greater indigenous rights, are in particular danger.
