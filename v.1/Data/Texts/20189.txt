 Mexico: Demand law to ban enforced disappearance | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 From 19 January 2012, the state government and legislature of Nuevo Le√≥n, northern Mexico, are considering a proposed bill to criminalise enforced disappearance. With 50,000 people killed and thousands missing in Mexico since 2006, this is a crucial opportunity to increase the chance of justice for people who are abducted and disappeared."
