 Coen Hussein Pontoh, Dita Sari, Mohammad Shaleh, Hendrik Dikson Sirait, aged 24, Lisa Febrianti (f), aged 22, Trio Yohanus Mulyato, Zainal Abidin, aged 24, I Sunarman Purwosaputro, Patriatno, Titin, Agus Sukarmanto, Syamsul Bachri, Agustyana, Nyonya B Veronica Sembiring: AI is concerned for the safety of at least 14 people detained in relation to disturbances which took place after the security forces raided the office of the Indonesian Democratic Party in Jakarta on 27 July 1996. The police raid was an attempt to remove supporters of the former party chairwoman Megawati Sukarnoputri. The raid and subsequent disturbances resulted in dozens of PDI members being injured and large-scale arrests on 27 and 28 July. Amnesty International believes that most, if not all, of them are prisoners of conscience.
