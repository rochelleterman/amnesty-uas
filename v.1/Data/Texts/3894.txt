 Maria Aparecida Denadai, a lawyer working in the state of Espçrito Santo, is again in grave danger after protection being provided for her by the Federal Police was withdrawn without explanation. Maria Aparecida Denadai has reported receiving persistent death threats and has been subjected to intimidation as a result of the investigation surrounding the killing of her brother, lawyer Marcelo Denadai, in 2002. He had been preparing to reveal evidence on political corruption when he was killed, and since then, another five witnesses in the case have also been killed.
