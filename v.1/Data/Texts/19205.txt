 Hamma Hammami, a prisoner of conscience, has been denied access to his family and lawyers since 7 December 1994 when he embarked on a hunger-strike. Prisoners on hunger-strike are held permanently chained in solitary confinement with inadequate clothing and bedding. Hamma Hammami suffers from heart and kidney conditions, and there are fears that he may currently be denied adequate medical care."
