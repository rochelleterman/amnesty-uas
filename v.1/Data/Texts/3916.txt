 Police have arrested the leader of the Trukæ indigenous people of north-eastern Brazil, and are holding him in a prison where he is reportedly at risk of violence from other inmates. His brother and nephew have been shot dead, allegedly by members of a military police death squad. The gunmen are still at large, and other Trukæ are believed to be in danger, particularly relatives of the dead men.
