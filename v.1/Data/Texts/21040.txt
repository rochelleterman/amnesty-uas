 India: Protestors could face life imprisonment | Amnesty International

 At least 16 people campaigning against the construction of a nuclear power plant in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu could be arrested on charges of sedition at any time. If found guilty of these charges, they could be sentenced to life imprisonment. Amnesty International believes that the Indian government has fabricated the charges against the group, in an effort to silence their peaceful protests."
