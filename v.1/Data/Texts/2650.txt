 AI is seriously concerned for the safety of the relatives of 28 army officers executed in 1990. In recent days, as in previous years, several women have been detained and tortured. It is feared that they may face further torture if redetained. The demonstrations to commemorate the officers took place on 25 February 1995; 28 of their female relatives, accompanied by chidren, took part. Reports indicate that they were severely beaten by security forces; those arrested were reportedly also beaten and threatened in detention. There is particular concern for Samira Hassan Ali Karrar, who AI fears is at risk of being killed bacause she is perceived to be the leader of the group of relatives and the organizer of their demonstrations and political activities."
