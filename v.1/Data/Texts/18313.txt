 Dr 'Abdullah al-Hamed was arrested at his home by members of al-Mabahith al-'Amma (General Intelligence) on 15 June 1993 and taken to an unknown location, where it is feared he may be subject to torture or ill-treatment. Dr 'Abdullah al-Hamed, a writer and lecturer at al-Imam Muhammad bin Saud University in Riyadh, was one of the six founding members of Lujnat al- Difa' 'an al-Huquq al-Shar'iyya, Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights (CDLR) in Saudi Arabia. The spokesperson of the CDLR, Dr Muhammad al-Mas'ari has been held incommunicado since his arrest on 15 May, and has allegedly been tortured with sleep deprivation.
