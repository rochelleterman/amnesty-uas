 UA 338/92 - Colombia: fear of extrajudicial execution: Gustavo Chinchilla Jaimes | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The body of Gustavo Chinchilla Jaimes, a member of the San Silvestre Drivers' Union of Barrancabermeja, Santander Department, was found on 29 October 1992 in Bogota, in circumstances which suggest that he may have been extrajudicially executed. Gustavo Chinchilla had moved from Barrancabermeja to Bogota with his wife and family and was on the point of leaving Colombia because of death threats against him. In July 1992 he and the president of the union, Parmenio Ruiz Suarez, had made an official complaint following death threats to members of the union. Parmenio Ruiz Suarez was shot dead on 30 July 1992. Gustavo Chinchilla is the sixth member of the San Silvestre Drivers' Union to be killed this year. "
