 The children named in this action suffer from congenital heart diseases. They need urgent surgery that cannot be provided in Gaza but which is available in East Jerusalem. Five of the children have so far not been able to leave Gaza because the Israeli authorities have refused to grant permission for the children's mothers or grandmothers to accompany them. Fifteen other children suffering from similar conditions were allowed to travel from Gaza to the hospital in East Jerusalem in the first days of November 2008."
