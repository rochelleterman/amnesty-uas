 NA 
 Narayan Reddy was released on bail on 19 May after five months in prison. He is part of a campaign against South Korean company POSCO's intended acquisition of common lands used by local farmers in the eastern Indian state of Orissa, to build a steel plant. He is still facing a murder charge, which Amnesty International believes has no basis."
