 Corlson Dorme, a radio correspondent for Radio Tropic FM in Port-au-Prince, has reportedly been missing since 1 February 1993 after submitting a radio report covering a pro-government demonstration. The four others, correspondents with Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France Press in Port-au-Prince, all received death threats during the same demonstration. AI fears that Corlson Dorme may have been abducted by the security forces with them and that he may ""disappear"". AI is also concerned about the reported death threats against the other journalists.
