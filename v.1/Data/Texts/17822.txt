 Israel/Lebanon: Thousands of civilians in southern Lebanon | Amnesty International 
 Thousands of civilians are trapped in villages in southern Lebanon, where they are at grave risk from frequent Israeli air strikes and shelling. They are cut off from the outside world, in increasingly difficult conditions, with no access to medical services, adequate food, electricity or fuel. Among them are elderly and disabled people, as well as women and children.
