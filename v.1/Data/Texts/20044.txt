 Ecuador: Possible prisoner of conscience/legal concern: Guadalupe Llori  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Guadalupe Llori, the governor (prefecta) of the province of Orellana is being detained in the El Inca women's prison in the capital, Quito, on what appear to be charges of terrorism, sabotage and fraud. Amnesty International believes that these charges may be politically motivated, as Guadalupe Llori represents an opposition political party. She may be a prisoner of conscience."
