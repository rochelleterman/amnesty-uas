 Greece: Prisoner of Conscience, Boris Sotiriadis | Amnesty International 
 On 22 August, the Military Court of Xanthi sentenced Boris Sotiriadis to an unprecedented three and a half years' imprisonment without suspension even pending appeal, on charges of disobedience after he refused to serve in the army on the grounds that it conflicted with his religious belief. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience and calls for his immediate and unconditional release.
