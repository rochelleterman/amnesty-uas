 Several members of the PAEPD, including its President, Jean-Pierre Josue, Saintil Alcidor, Gerard Michel and Dr Fernand Hachette, have recently been subjected to threats, harassment and attempts to arrest them. Concern for their safety is heightened by the killings since September 1993 of several PAEPD members by armed men in civilian clothes, believed to be members of the security forces. In November 1993 an application for asylum was made by members of the PAEPD at the International Organization for Migration (OIM)."
