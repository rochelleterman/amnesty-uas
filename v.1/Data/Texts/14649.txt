 On 6 May 1993, after up to 14 days in incommunicado detention, all the detainees named above were brought before a judge in Istanbul State Security Court. Hasan Durna, Cafer Oral and Ayhan Uzala were arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of membership of an illegal armed organization. Together with Nurettin Topuz, they have alleged that they were tortured. Ayhan Uzala was reportedly very seriously tortured. The remaining detainees were released and Nurettin Topuz and Duzgun Gok have returned to Germany where they are currently working. "
