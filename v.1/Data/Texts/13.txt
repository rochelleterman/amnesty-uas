"Rwanda/Burundi: Fear of refoulement / fear for safety: thousands of Burundi refugees in Rwanda 
 NA 
 On 25 January 1996 a high level delegation of Burundi and Rwanda government authorities visited Kigeme camp in Gikongoro prefecture, and Musange transit centre in Butare prefecture. During these visits the refugees were told that they were expected to leave Rwanda by 5 February 1997. There is concern that thousands of Burundi refugees in Rwanda face forcible return, despite the fact that they face the risk of grave human rights violations in Burundi.
