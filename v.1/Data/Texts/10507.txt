 Myanmar: Prisoners of conscience/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Four men: U Thaung Sein; U Soe; U Par Lay; and U Pu were  arrested on 24 June for     attempting to help a          political prisoner. All four are     local leaders of the National League for Democracy. Amnesty    International   believes that the four are prisoners of     conscience,   arrested solely for their membership of a     non-violent political party and their work in defence of  human       rights.
