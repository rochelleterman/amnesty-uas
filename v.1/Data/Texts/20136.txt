 On 28 September, a landowner, accompanied by armed men, made violent threats against more than 300 people in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, who have been living in a makeshift camp on his property since their homes were destroyed in the January 2010 earthquake. Amnesty International is extremely concerned for their safety and that if evicted they will be forced to live on the streets."
