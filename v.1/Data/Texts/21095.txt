 There is a high risk of imminent executions of death row inmates in Japan, after Taki Makoto, who was appointed Minister of Justice in Japan on 4 June, stated that he supports the death penalty. Estimates suggest that there are over 130 death row inmates; all of whom are at imminent risk of execution."
