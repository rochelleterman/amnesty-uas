 Workers at the newspaper Noticias, in the southern city of Oaxaca, have been threatened and intimidated by members of a trade union controlled by the state government. The union is picketing the newspaper's office in the city of Oaxaca in an apparent attempt to close the publication, which supports a coalition of local opposition parties.
