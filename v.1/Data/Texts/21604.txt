 Lithuania: Baltic Pride will go ahead: Further information | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Supreme Administrative Court in Vilnius, Lithuania, ruled today (7 May 2010) that Baltic Pride will go ahead tomorrow. 350 people are expected to take part in the march on Saturday 8 May, including over 50 Amnesty International activists from more than 20 countries. Security threats emanating from counter-protesters should be policed effectively, rather than used as a pretext to ban public events. "
