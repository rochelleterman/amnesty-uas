 Rwanda: Women of Rwanda: Marked for death | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 10 years on from the genocide and war of 1994, the women  of Rwanda are still seeking redress for the violence done to them. Many women raped during 1994 now suffer the      reality of living with sexually transmitted diseases      including HIV/AIDS with little hope of legal recourse,    medical care or compensation."
