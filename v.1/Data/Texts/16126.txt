 UA 389/94 - Turkmenistan: ""disappearance"": Yusup Kuliyev | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Yusup Kuliyev has ""disappeared"" after reportedly being arrested by agents of the Committee for State Security (KGB) at his home in Ashgabat. No reason was given for his arrest at that time, but it was apparently part of a round-up of known or suspected government opponents prior to independence day celebrations on 27 October. All the others who were taken into police custody have since been released, but his family have been unable to obtain any information as to his whereabouts. Yusup Kuliyev is a former employee of the state newspaper Esh Kommunist (Young Communist), and more recently has worked as an editor at a documentary film studio and as a stringer for the US-financed Radio Liberty."
