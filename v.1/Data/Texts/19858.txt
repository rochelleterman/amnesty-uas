 Canada: Prisoner of Conscience:  Dean William Walcott | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Canadian authorities intend to deport US serviceman, Dean Walcott, to the USA on 30 January. He fled to Canada in December 2006 to avoid being sent to Iraq because of his conscientious objection to participating in the armed conflict there. If deported to the USA, he risks being court-martialled and jailed for up to five years. Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience"
