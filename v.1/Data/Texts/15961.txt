 Amnesty International has now learned the names of two Azerbaydzhani prisoners of war sentenced to death recently in Armenia. Bakhtiar Khanali ogly Shabiev and Garai Muzafar ogly Nagiev were reportedly convicted of murder and of attempting to poison a reservoir. Six other defendants received long terms of imprisonment. They have the right to appeal within seven days, and this may be extended to allow translation of the verdict. Three other Azerbaydzhani prisoners of war held as suspects, Raig Gabil ogly Guliev, Rustam Ramazan ogly Agaev and Bakhrat Akif ogly Giasov, are said to have committed suicide on 29 January 1994 after failing to escape from custody."
