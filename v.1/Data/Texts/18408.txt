"Saudi Arabia: Torture/Death penalty 
 Saudi Arabia: Torture/Death penalty | Amnesty International 
 Eight men have been shown on Saudi Arabian television ""confessing"" to planning terrorist acts.  The eight are: Abdullah Abdel Aziz al-Migrin, Ahmed Abdel Aziz al-Migrin, Khaled al-Kurdi, Mohamed Ali Hassan Zei, Ali Issa Umar, Khalid Ali Tahir, 'Amir Abdul Hamid Al-Sa'di and Muhammad Fatehi Al-Sayyid.  Amnesty International is concerned that they may have been tortured to force them to confess, and that they are at risk of further torture and also of being sentenced to death after unfair trials, and executed.
