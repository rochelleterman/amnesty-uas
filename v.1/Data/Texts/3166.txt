 Uganda: Incommunicado detention/fear of torture	 | Amnesty International 
 Ugandan police arrested at least 41 foreign nationals, including Titi Masudi, Kahindo Kabaya, Bikay Kusimuweri, Patrick Kabula, Ngunda Bawula and Fabrice Buregeya, in Kampala on 13 August. They were initially detained incommunicado at the headquarters of the police Rapid Response Unit in Kireka, Kampala. New reports suggest     that on 17 or 18 August some of the detainees were        transferred to Luzira, the central prison in Kampala.     Amnesty International is concerned that those who have    not yet been transferred from the police Rapid Response   Unit are being held incommunicado and are at risk of      torture.
