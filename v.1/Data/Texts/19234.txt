 Tunisia: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 The Tunisian authorities have effectively closed down the country's main human rights organisation. They now have   control of its offices and have access to all its files   on human rights violations by the state. The              organisation's leaders now face arrest if they continue   their human rights activities, and those who have         reported state human rights abuses risk further           persecution.
