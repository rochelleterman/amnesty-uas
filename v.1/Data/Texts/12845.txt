 Pakistan: Death threats/fear for safety/possible death penalty/prisoner of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Younis Masih (m), who is a Christian, has been charged with blasphemy, and is at risk of being sentenced to death. He is also in danger of being killed by other detainees, or prison staff, at the jail where he is held. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience held solely for the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. His lawyer, Parvez Aslam Choudhry (m), has received death threats. Amnesty International believes that both men are in grave danger.
