 On 21 November 1992, security forces detained some 50 people in Viransehir, Sanliurfa province, including the above-named members of the Ozkan family. Officers searching the house of Omer Ozkan that morning reportedly found a man wanted by the police: the houses of his brothers were then searched and the men were detained along with other members of the family. They are reportedly being held incommunicado at the Anti-Terror Branch of Sanliurfa Police, presumably on suspicion of supporting PKK guerrillas. AI fear that they may be tortured or ill-treated during interrogation. "
