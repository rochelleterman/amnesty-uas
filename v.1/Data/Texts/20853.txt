 China: Death penalty | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Two Tibetans, Losang Gyaltse and Loyar, were sentenced to death on 8 April 2009 by the Municipal Intermediate People's Court in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR). It is unclear if they will appeal against their sentence. Ultimately all death sentences are reviewed by China’s Supreme People’s Court, which has the power to approve, revise or remand death sentences. The two men could be executed within weeks. "
