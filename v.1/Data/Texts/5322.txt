 Colombia: Further information on  Fear for Safety | Amnesty International 
 Paramilitaries have killed at least  17 people Further to the 50 political killings   in the    past month, many of them apparently carried out by        paramilitaries      reportedly from a ""death list""   which       corrosponds  to a military intelligence        report. No apparent     action has been taken by the authorities to combat and    dismantle the groups. Amnesty International fears that    other civilians will be killed unless the authorities     take immediate and decisive action against the            paramilitaries.
