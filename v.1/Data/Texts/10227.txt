 On 17 October 1995, the six students named above were reported to have been arbitrarily detained by members of the National Guard in Naguanagua, Valencia, at a reportedly peaceful student demonstration. Fears for their safety have been heightened by reports that they have been beaten in detention. AI is concerned that the students will be imprisoned under the Law of Vagrants and Crooks which enables administrative authorities to imprison people without trial for up to five years under vague charges. The law is being used to suppress political and popular dissent."
