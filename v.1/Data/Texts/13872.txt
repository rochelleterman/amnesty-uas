 Belgium: Fear of forcible return / Torture /Unfair Trial | Amnesty International 
 Twelve Iranian nationals are at risk of forcible return to Iran as soon as the Belgian authorities obtain the appropriate documentation from the Iranian embassy. The group consists of refused asylum-seekers and irregular immigrants who were amongst 23 individuals that had been occupying a church (l'Eglise des Minimes) in Brussels for the past four months in an attempt to avoid being returned to Iran. If returned, they would be at risk of torture and an unfair trial.
