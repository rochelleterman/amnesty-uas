 Further information on UA 363/93 (AFR 53/39/93, 8 October) - South Africa: fear for safety / extrajudicial execution: Ronnie Mjoli, Boysie Mpofana, Wellington Mbili | Amnesty International

 On 12 October 1993, Ronnie Mjoli and Boysie Mpofana were released on bail, and not long after their release, the police withdrew all charges against them. Amnesty International is concerned that it has received no indication that the police have taken any steps to investigate the allegations of police assault against the three men. There is also concern that so far no findings of the investigation into the death of Wellington Mbili, who died in police custody on 4 October 1993, have been made public."
