 Mexico: Fear for safety: Members of CONPAZ, human rights organization | Amnesty International 
 On 4 November 1996, the offices of the non-governmental human rights organization Coordination of Non-Governmental Organizations for Peace, in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, were raided by unidentified individuals who also tried to set fire to the building. This is the fourth and most serious attack carried against CONPAZ during the past months. Amnesty International belieives CONPAZ has been targeted for its human rights advocacy in the state of Chiapas and its outspoken criticism about governmental inaction to stop human rights violations.
