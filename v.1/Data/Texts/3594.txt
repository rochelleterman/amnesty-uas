 UA 336/94 - Argentina: death threats: Elena Mendoza | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Dr Elena Mendoza, a human rights lawyer from Buenos Aires, working with the organization Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, ""Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo"", who has recently started to receive death threats. These threats are believed to be related to her civil and criminal court work on behalf of the grandmother of a girl ""disappeared"" during the years of military rule. A man called Eduardo Ruffo, reportedly a former member of a ""death squad"", known as Alianza Antiterrorista Argentina (AAA) was sentenced to 6 years in prison for the abduction of the girl, and ordered to pay compensation to her family. Dr Mendoza has reported these threats to the judiciary but has not been granted protection by the authorities."
