 Approximately 50,000 civilians are trapped in the worsening humanitarian crisis in the Mullaitivu District of northern Sri Lanka. They lack food and medical care and are at grave risk of injury or death in the conflict between Sri Lankan government forces and an armed opposition group called the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The International Committee of the Red Cross has described the situation as ‘catastrophic’."
