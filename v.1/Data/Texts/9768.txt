 Robert Shaw, black, is scheduled to be executed in Missouri on 3 December 1992. He was sentenced to death in November 1980 for the murder of a white prison officer while serving a prison sentence for the murder of a relative. Robert Shaw is mentally retarded, with an IQ of about 70. Shortly before a previous execution date in May 1990, he underwent examinations which found that he was suffering from organic brain syndrome and that he was mentally incompetent to be executed. However, the director of Missouri Department of Corrections has refused requests from Shaw's attorneys to hold a hearing on this issue because the state obtained psychiatric opinion to rebut the above-mentioned tests. Evidence of his brain damage was not presented at his original trial. "
