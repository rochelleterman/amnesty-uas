 Colombia: Fear for safety / extrajudicial execution | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that paramilitary      organizations are stepping up attacks against human       rights defenders while world attention is focussed on the humanitarian disaster caused by the recent earthquake in  Colombia, in order to avoid the full condemnation of the  international community. Everardo de JesËs Puertas and    Julio Ernesto Gonz?lez were killed by paramilitaries on   30 Jnauary 1999.
