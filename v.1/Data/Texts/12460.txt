 The above four people named above were also killed when police opened fire on demonstrators in Kathmandu valley between 25 and 28 June 1993. It has been reported that on 4 July in Kathmandu during a further strike called by the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) (CPN-UML) and other left-wing opposition parties, the police refrained from firing and dispersed the crowd using tear gas and batons. However they arrested hundreds of demonstrators. It has also been reported that in Siraha police fired into the air and in Bara a few people were injured by batons. A number of professional people and human rights activists have formed a committee to monitor the situation and to try to prevent further human rights violations occurring. "
