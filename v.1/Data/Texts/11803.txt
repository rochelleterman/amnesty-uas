 Indonesia: Fear of torture / arbitrary arrest 

 | Amnesty International 
 Up to 99 Papuan people, including around 50 students,     have been detained and some have been tortured in         apparent retaliation for the killing of at least two      police officers. Amnesty International believes that the  detainees are at grave risk of torture or ill-treatment.
