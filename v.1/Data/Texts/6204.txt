 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Judge Yolanda Perez Ruiz, of the Second Court of Instruction in the Department of Chimaltenango. According to reports, on 11 February 1994, an unidentified man took photographs of the Chimaltenango court and its staff. On 18 February Judge Perez received an anonymous phone call informing her that she would be kidnapped. These attempts at intimidation continued with a bomb threat in the court on 25 February, and continuous surveillance by unknown men. This intimidation apparently stems from her work on the case of Jose Mercedes Similox Telon."
