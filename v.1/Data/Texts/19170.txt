 UA 236/94 - Tunisia: possible prisoner of conscience / fear of unfair trial: Najib Hosni | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Najib Hosni, a human rights lawyer from El Kef, was arrested on 15 June and is currently detained in El Kef Prison. He is apparently accused of falsifying a contract, but there are fears he may be a prisoner of conscience, held because of his work in defending prisoners of conscience and other political prisoners. Over the past year he has been subjected to continuous harassment by the authorities."
