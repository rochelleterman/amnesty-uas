 Ukraine: Execution despite moratorium / fear of imminent executions | Amnesty International 
 Sasha Markitan, aged 21, Vitaly Alkhimov, aged 23, Sergey Skarabagatov, aged 24, Aleksey Vedmedenko, aged 20; Vladimir Yurevich Ogoltsov, aged 20: AI is appalled at reports of the recent execution of Vladimir Yurevich Ogoltsov, despite the fact that Ukraine, by joining the Council of Europe had committed itself to imposing an immediate moratorium on executions and to abolish the death penalty within three years. According to unofficial sources, he was transferred to Dnepropetrovsk prison where he was executed. The same sources report that the other men mentioned above, all sentenced to death, were transferred to the same prison recently. AI believes them to be at imminent risk of execution.
