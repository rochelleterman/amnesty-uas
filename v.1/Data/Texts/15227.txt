 The villagers of Hassana were reportedly forced to leave their village. Those who left before the 20 November deadline were allowed to take some possessions with them but those who were forced to leave on 20 November could not take anything with them. The villagers, 31 families comprising 199 persons, have been offered neither alternative places for settlement nor compensation. In the period before the evacuation, Turkish television reportedly broadcast false information that the villagers were Armenians in league with the guerillas of the PKK."
