 AI has received more information on the case of Igor Yurevich Kopytin, prisoner on death row in Belarus. He has been in detention since 15 September 1993. It is now known that his appeal against his death sentence to the Supreme Court was turned down on 1 September, and that his last hope of avoiding execution depends on the President of Belarus upholding his petition for clemency."
