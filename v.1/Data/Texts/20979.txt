 China: Fear of torture and other ill-treatment / Prisoner of conscience | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Falun Gong practitioner Xu Na is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. She was sentenced to three years in prison on 25 November for ‘crimes’ related to her membership of an outlawed spiritual movement which has been targeted by the Chinese authorities. Amnesty International believes she is a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of conscience and religion."
