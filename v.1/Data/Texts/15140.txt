 EXTRA 98/93 - Turkey: fear of ""disappearance"" / fear of torture: Erdogan Oktay | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Erdogan Oktay, a 23-year-old agricultural engineer, was detained in the town of Tunceli on 25 October 1993 and remains in unacknowledged police custody. He was detained when the bus he was travelling on to work was stopped at a road block. Several other passengers were also detained, but are believed to have been released. He is thought to be held at Tunceli Police Headquarters. Neither his father nor his lawyer have been able to gain access to him or even to obtain confirmation of his detention. There is concern that he may be subjected to torture during interrogation."
