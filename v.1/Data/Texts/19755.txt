 Democratic Republic of Congo: Further information on Incommunicado detention/Fear of torture and other ill-treatment: Pépé Nginamau Malaba | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 17 February 2009, after nearly one month in illegal incommunicado detention, trade union leader Pépé Nginamau Malaba was transferred to Kinshasa’s central prison. Amnesty International considers that he is no longer at risk of torture or ill-treatment. However, the organization remains concerned that he might be a prisoner of conscience and will continue to follow the case closely."
