 Haiti: Further information on Fear for safety/Death threats | Amnesty International 
 Human rights lawyer Evel Fanfan and his family have suffered further intimidation and harassment. Amnesty International is seriously concerned that their lives continue to be at risk and believes that they are not receiving sufficient support and protection from the Haitian National Police. Other members of his organization (the Association of University Graduates Motivated for a Haiti with Rights), including Colin Reginal and Montes Plaisimâ, may also be in serious danger.
