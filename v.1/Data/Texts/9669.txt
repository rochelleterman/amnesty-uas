 USA (Texas): Further information on death penalty / legal concern: Joseph Stanley Faulder | Amnesty International 
 Joseph Stanley Faulder, scheduled to be executed on 10 December 1998, received a stay of execution 20 minutes before he was to be put to death. The US Supreme Court issued the stay of execution on the grounds that it needed more time to examine the impact of the violation of Faulder's right to consular assistance. The Court is expected to review its stay order and to take a decision on further action in early 1999.
