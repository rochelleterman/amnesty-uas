 According to information provided by the Emergency Region Governor in Diyarbakir, the above are both in detention in Bitlis. This means that Serif Yilmaz, has now been held by the gendarmerie in incommunicado detention for nearly a month without access to his parents or a lawyer. This is in breach of Statute 2253 of Turkish law which requires that minors are questioned by the prosecutor only and that their next of kin are informed of their whereabouts."
