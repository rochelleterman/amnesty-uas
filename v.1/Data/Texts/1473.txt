 Mauritania: Fear of ill-treatment or torture/ Incommunicado detention/ Medical concern | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the safety of those named above. They are being held in incommunicado detention apparently without charge. At least one detainee has reportedly been ill treated, whilst four others are reported to require urgent medical attention. The authorities are denying the detainees' access to legal representatives, family members and medical treatment, despite repeated requests.
