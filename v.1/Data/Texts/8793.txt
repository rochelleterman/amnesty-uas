 NA 
 James Dean Clark, white, is scheduled to be executed in Arizona on 14 April 1993. He was sentenced to death in 1978 for the murder of three white men and a woman. At his original trial he was represented by an inexperienced attorney who failed to present any mitigating evidence about his mental disorders and family background and who failed also to interview any witnesses before the trial.
