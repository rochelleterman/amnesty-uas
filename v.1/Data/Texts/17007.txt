 UA 398/94 - Iran: fear of torture: Retired General Azizollah Amir Rahimi, Mehrdad Amir Rahimi, his son | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There are fears that the father and son named above may be in incommunicado detention. Retired General Azizollah Amir Rahimi, a former commander of the military police, was arrested and interrogated on 31 October 1994 and released on 1 November. However, he was rearrested on 3 November and reportedly beaten by members of the secret police. He is reportedly held in Evin Prison's hospital. His detention appears to be due to public criticisms he has made of the Iranian regime. His son, aged 28, was arrested on 8 November. He had protested about his father's arrest and given interviews to foreign media. His whereabouts are unknown."
