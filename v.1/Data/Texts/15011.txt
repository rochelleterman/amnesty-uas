 Those named above, including children, were reportedly killed and injured by security forces between the night of 18 August and noon on 21 August 1992 in Sirnak, southeastern Turkey. Four members of the security forces were also killed. Five hundred people were detained, of whom 140 remain in detention. It was reported initially that PKK guerrillas had attacked government buildings in Sirnak and that the security forces responded by bombing and shelling shops and houses. The PKK have subsequently denied launching an attack. Journalists who arrived in Sirnak after a partial lifting of the curfew say that they were prevented from speaking to local politicians. Thousands have fled Sirnak and there have been reports of further attacks on civilians in surrounding villages. "
