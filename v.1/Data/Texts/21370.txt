 NA 
 Conscientious objector Enver Aydemir was freed on 8 June 2010 after a medical report concluded that he had an ""antisocial personality disorder"" and was ""unfit for military service"". The report was issued even though Enver Aydemir had refused to undergo psychiatric tests at the hospital. He had been referred to the GÃ¼lhane Military Medical Academy on 1 June at the request of military judges at his trial for ""persistent insubordination""."
