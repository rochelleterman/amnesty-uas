 AI is concerned by reports that at least 13 alleged members of the EZLN taken into custody between 8 and 10 February 1995 have been tortured. A delegation of opposition Members of Congress visited the first eight named above on 10 February. They reported that several of them bore visible signs of torture. The eight were reportedly not taken to the Office of the Procurator General after arrest, as required by law, but to unknown locations for interrogation. AI fears that any of the detainees named above may be taken back into police custody for interrogation and further ill-treated or torture."
