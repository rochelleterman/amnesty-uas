 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Jose Soliven, a 56-year-old farmer from barangay (administrative unit) Magsaysay, Mulanay, Quezon province, who ""disappeared"" on 30 March 1992. He was last seen in barangay Tagbakan, Catanauan, Quezon province, when witnesses have described how he was apprehended by several members of a Citizens Armed Force Geographical Unit (CAGFU). He is believed to have been targeted on suspicion of helping the New People's Army (NPA), following a recent encounter between the NPA and the military. "
