 Sri Lanka: Extrajudicial execution / rape: Murugesupillai Koneswary | Amnesty International 
 Murugesupillai Koneswary, a 35-year-old mother of four, was killed at her home in 11th Colony village in a grenade attack on 17 May 1997. Circumstantial evidence suggests that she may have been raped prior to being killed and that the perpetrators may have been one or more police officers attached to the nearby Central Camp police station. Amnesty International is calling for a full investigation into the killing and possible rape, and for those responsible to be brought to justice.
