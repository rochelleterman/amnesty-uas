 Iran: Further information on arbitrary arrests/ prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Seven members of the Baha’i religious minority have been charged with vaguely worded charges relating to national security. According to press reports, Tehran's deputy prosecutor claimed that they had “confessed” to setting up an illegal organisation in Iran that took orders from Israel and other states to undermine the ‘Islamic system’. Amnesty International considers the charges politically motivated and that those held are prisoners of conscience, detained solely because of their conscientiously held beliefs or their peaceful activities on behalf of the Baha’i community."
