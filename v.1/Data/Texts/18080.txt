 Lebanon: Fear of torture: members of opposition groups | Amnesty International 
 There is concern that dozens of people, mostly from Christian opposition groups, have been arrested between 18 and 21 December, following armed attacks on Syrian targets in Lebanon on 18 December. There is concern that some of those arrested were reportedly tortured, that arrests were made without warrants, and that detainees have not been allowed access to lawyers.
