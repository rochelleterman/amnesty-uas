 Colombia: Further information on possible extrajudicial execution / fear for safety: Manuel Cepeda Vargas, parliamentarian | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 One year after the killing of Senator Manuel Cepeda Vargas on 9 August 1994, paramilitary leaders implicated in his killing by judicial investigations remain at large. Responsibility for the killing of Manuel Cepeda, the only senator in the Colombian Congress belonging to the Union Patriotica (UP) and the Partido Comunista Colombiano (PCC), was claimed by the paramilitary group ""Muerte a Comunistas y Guerrilleros"". AI is concerned that continued impunity in such a high-profile case threatens to contribute to human rights violations against members of opposition political parties."
