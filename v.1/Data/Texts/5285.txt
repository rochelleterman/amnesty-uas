 Paramilitary gunmen, backed by the army, are continuing to threaten forcibly displaced communities who have returned to their lands in the departments of Choc— and Antioquia unless they once again abandon the region. Most recently the Peace Community of Natividad de Mar’a has come under attack. A group of paramilitaries rounded up the inhabitants and accused them of being guerilla sympathisers, and threatened to kill them.
