 Syrian political activist Ahmed Mustafa Ben-Mohammed, usually known by his pen name of Pir Rostom, was released on bail on 27 April 2010. He continues to await possible referral for trial on charges such as inciting sectarian and racial strife. It is believed that these relate to articles written by him that were published online. Amnesty International believes that Pir Rostom is no longer at imminent risk of torture or other ill-treatment. "
