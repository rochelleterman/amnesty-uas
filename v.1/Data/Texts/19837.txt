 Thirty-five families of the Guarani-Kaiowá community of Laranjeira Ñanderu face imminent eviction from their ancestral lands in Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil. If they are evicted they will be forced to live by the side of a busy highway on the outskirts of a nearby town, with no access to water or land to plant crops.  "
