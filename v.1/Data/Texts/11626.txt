 Indonesia: Health concern / possible prisoner of conscience: Amin Baharuddin | Amnesty International 
 AI is concerned for the health of the above, a student activist, who was badly wounded during a demonstration held in Jakarta on 4 June in protest at the use of excessive force by the security forces during student riots in Ujung Pandang on the island of Sulawasi in April 1996. He is currently being detained at Police Resort, Central Jakarta, where he is reported to be in need of medical attention. AI is further concerned that the real reason for his detention may be his peaceful political activities.
