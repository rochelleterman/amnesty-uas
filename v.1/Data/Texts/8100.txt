 Peru: Fear for safety / prisoner of conscience: General Rodolfo Robles Espinoza
 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned about the arbitrary detention on 26 November 1996 of dissident retired army general Rodolfo Robles Espinoza, following public statements he made, in which he attributed responsibility for a recent bomb attack and several summary executions to the Colina Group, linked to Peru's military intelligence services. The organization considers General Robles to be a prisoner of conscience and fears for his safety in detention.
