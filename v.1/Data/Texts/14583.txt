 On 27 February 1995, police entered the offices of Diyarbakir HRA and detained five more members of the branch (names given above). They had been working to keep the office open since the first arrests. They are reportedly being interrogated at Diyarbakir Gendarmerie Regimental Headquarters. AI considers them to be prisoners of conscience and is calling for their immediate and unconditional release. The organization fears that they may be ill-treated in incommunicado detention."
