 USA (New Hampshire): Death penalty / Legal concern | Amnesty International 
 On 22 April, the New Hampshire House of Representatives voted in favour of legislation to raise from 17 to 18 the minimum age at which a person can be eligible for the death penalty in the state. The bill had already passed the Senate, and will now proceed to the Governor. However, Governor Craig Benson has indicated that he will veto the legislation. Amnesty International urges him to respect the will of the legislature and international law on this issue and allow the bill into New Hampshire law.
