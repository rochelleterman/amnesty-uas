 Mexico: Fear for safety / Death threats | Amnesty International 
 Journalists Gonzalo Dominguez Monroy (m), Felipe Ramos Cruz (m) and Carlos Dominguez Monroy (m) and others       working for El Imparcial del Istmo newspaper in Oaxaca have been receiving death threats, apparently as a result of the newspaper's coverage of a drug-trafficking gang's activities in the state. After their colleagues Mateo Cortâs MartÁnez (m), Flor VÊsquez L¢pez (f) and AgustÁn L¢pez Nolasco (m)  were shot dead earlier during the week beginning 8 October 2007, Amnesty International is deeply concerned for the safety of other workers at the same newspaper.
