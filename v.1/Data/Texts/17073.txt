 NA 
 Ahmed Bakhtari, a 38-year-old agricultural engineer, was sentenced to death by an Islamic Revolutionary Court on 17 January 1993, reportedly after being convicted of membership of an illegal opposition group. His sentence was confirmed on 20 October, and there is concern that his execution may be imminent. He is currently held at Evin Prison, Teheran. His trial was reportedly grossly unfair, as he was not given access to a lawyer."
