 Morocco/Western Sahara: Fear of unfair imprisonment/ Prisoners of conscience  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 30 January 2008, the Moroccan Court of Cassation is due to hand down its judgement on the case of 10 men who are all members of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (Association Marocaine des Droits Humains, AMDH). They were convicted in August 2007 of “undermining the monarchy” by a court of appeal. If the conviction is confirmed Amnesty International would consider them to be prisoners of conscience."
