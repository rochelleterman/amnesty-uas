 Hani el-Sayegh was handed over to the government of Saudi Arabia by the US authorities on 11 October 1999. He was   arrested immediately on arrival, and his whereabouts are  now unknown. Amnesty International is concerned that he   is at risk of torture, and at risk of execution after an  unfair trial.
