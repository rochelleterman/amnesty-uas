 Johnnie Baston was executed by lethal injection in Ohio on 10 March 2010 after the governor rejected clemency. The murder victim's family were opposed to his execution. The company that produces the drug used in the execution had explicitly urged Ohio not to use it for carrying out the death penalty."
