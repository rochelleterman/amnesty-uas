 The above-named is reported to have been freed from detention by mid- September 1992. He was apparently transferred to Landja military camp after release for medical treatment. Reports suggest that he had earlier been subjected to torture. A representative of the Togolese President delivered a letter apparently signed by Captain Pello to Amnesty International on 1 October 1992; it was primarily a refutation of rumours in Togo that he had died."
