 Min Ze Ya, Paw U Tun, Ko Ko Gyi and seven other political activists arrested since August 2007 were charged with breaking a vaguely worded security law on 23 January 2008, according to reliable sources. They are all held in Yangonâ€™s Insein Prison, where they risk being tortured or otherwise ill-treated. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience, held solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression and peaceful association.
