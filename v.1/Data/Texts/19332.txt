 Yemen: Imminent execution, Fuad 'Ali Mohsin al-Shahari

 | Amnesty International 
 Fuad 'Ali Mohsen al-Shahari, who was sentenced to death after what appears to have been an unfair trial, is now facing imminent execution. His death sentence has reportedly been upheld by the Supreme Court; if the President now ratifies the sentence, it may be carried out at any time.
