 DRC/Rwanda: Further information on ""disappearance"" / fear for safety: Francine   Ngoy (f) | Amnesty International 
 Francine Ngoy was reportedly released in the DRC, on 6    January 2000, but ordered not to leave the town of Goma,  and to report to the authorities there every day. Amnesty International is concerned that she remains at risk of    further human rights violations - including               ""disappearance"" - by members of the Rassemblement         congolais pour la d_mocratie (RCD), Congolese Rally for   Democracy, or the Rwandese security forces.
