 The above-named were detained between 26 February 1995 and 3 March 1995 after eight Venezuelan soldiers were reportedly ambushed and killed on 26 February by Colombian guerrillas in the vicinity of Puerto Ayacucho. Fears for their safety have been increased by reports that one of them has been killed and several others tortured in custody. AI is concerned about these reports and is requesting an immediate and impartial investigation. AI is also calling for the detainees to be given immediate access to doctors, lawyers and their relatives and for them to be charged with a recognizably criminal offence or immediately released."
