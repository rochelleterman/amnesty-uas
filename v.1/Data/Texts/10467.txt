 AI has learned the names of five more young activists who were among some 50 arrested detained in connection with the demonstration at U Nu's funeral on 20 February 1995. It is not known how many of the original fifty remain in detention, but the 18 people named above are thought still to be held. It is not known whether any of the 18 have been charged and tried. There is concern for the safety of all those detained."
