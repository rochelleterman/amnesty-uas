 Philippines: Further information on Imminent Execution: Eduardo Agbayani | Amnesty International 
 Eduardo Agbayani was executed by lethal injection today.  President Estrada decided at the last minute to grant a   stay of execution, reportedly on the urging of an         influential bishop in the Catholic church, but the call   from the presidential palace at 3.09 pm came too late.    Eduardo Agbayani died two minutes after the call arrived.
