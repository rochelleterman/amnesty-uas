 Mexico: Further Information on Fear for safety; New concern: Harassment: Cristina Auerbach Benavides (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Cristina Auerbach Benavides, a well known campaigner, with the Catholic organization Pastoral Laboral, has recently been harassed in Mexico City home by men claiming to be police. This appears to be a further attempt to intimidate her and deter her from working on behalf of the families of 65 miners who died in an explosion at the Pasta de Conchos coal mine in Coahuila state."
