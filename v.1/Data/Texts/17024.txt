"Iran: Further information on prisoners of conscience / death penalty 
 NA 
 Dhabihullah Mahrami, Musa Talibi: According to media reports the Supreme Court has officially confirmed the death sentences against these two men. Previous reports suggested that both had been convicted of apostasy, however, a report from the Iranian news agency IRNA on 23 February states that the Head of the Revolutionary Court said that both men had been convicted of espionage. It is commonplace for the Iranian authorities to deny that the Baha'i community follows any recognised religion, often accusing them unfoundedly of espionage. Amnesty International believes that both men are prisoners of conscience, held solely on account of their religious beliefs, and is calling for their immediate and unconditional release.
