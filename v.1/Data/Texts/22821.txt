 Syria: Incommunicado detention/ fear of torture or ill-treatment/possible prisoners of conscience  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Peaceful advocates of political reform, Feda’a al-Horani, Akram al-Bunni, ‘Ali al-‘Abdullah, Ahmad To’meh and Jabr al-Shoufi have been held incommunicado without charge since their arrests between 9-17 December 2007. Amnesty International believes that they are being held at State Security branches, where they are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Amnesty International considers all of them to be probable prisoners of conscience, detained solely for their peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association."
