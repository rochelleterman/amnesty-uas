 Police and soldiers cordoned off the Duhaney Park district of the capital, Kingston, on 9 April, and raided a number of homes, killing Micheal Scarlett, n in an apparent extrajudicial execution. They beat and arrested his pregnant girlfriend, Kaydeen Brown, and charged her with possession of firearms, in an apparent attempt to intimidate her so that she does not testify about the killing. She is at grave risk of beatings and other ill-treatment in custody, as are the three men named above, who were arrested the same day.
