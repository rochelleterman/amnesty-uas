 Iraq: Death threats/fear of extrajudicial executions | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Several journalists and writers from the Kurdistan region of Iraq have received death threats in recent days. One of those threatened, Souran â€˜Omar, was named on a list of journalists at risk of being killed, apparently for their criticism of political parties in the region. Two others named on the list have been killed. Amnesty International fears for the lives of the three men named above and the 13 others who appeared on the list."
