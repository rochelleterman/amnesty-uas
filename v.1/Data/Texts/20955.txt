 Ablikim Abdiriyim, third son of Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer, had difficulty recognizing members of his family during their 15-minute visit on 6 December 2007, according to reliable reports. Chinese authorities reportedly attributed Ablikim Abdiriyim’s failing health to a heart condition, and suggested that his condition could become worse if he continued to refuse to “cooperate with the authorities”. The prison authorities' continuing ill-treatment of Ablikim Abdiriyim, and denial of adequate medical treatment, is putting his life at risk."
