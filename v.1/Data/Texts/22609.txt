 Saudi Arabia: Further information: Saudi Arabian King should pardon ""sorcerer"": Abdul Hamid al-Fakki | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Abdul Hamid al-Fakki, a Sudanese man sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia in 2007 for “sorcery”, should be pardoned by the Saudi Arabian King in the coming month. During Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting which this year lasts from 11 August until around 9 September, Saudi Arabia's King often pardons prisoners. Amnesty International is calling on him to take this opportunity to commute the death sentence of Abdul Hamid al-Fakki."
