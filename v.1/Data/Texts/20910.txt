 Medical Action:China -ill-health of  Xiao Yunliang and Yao Fuxin, prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned about the poor health of Xiao Yunliang (57) and Yao Fuxin (53).     Both are prisoners of conscience and trade union          activists from China's Liaoning province. According to    their families who last visited them on 22 October, the   two men believe that due to the lack of medical treatment and the seriousness of their medical conditions they may  die in prison                                             "
