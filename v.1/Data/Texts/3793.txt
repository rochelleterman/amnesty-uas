 Marco Antonio Rufino da Cruz, a civil servant at the National Library in Rio de Janeiro and leader of the Civil Servants Union of the National Library, was reportedly arrested on 26 November 1994 during an anti-crime operation by joint forces of army and police personnel in Rio de Janeiro by members of the Army Police. On 17 January 1995, a police chief reportedly registered in writing that he had been held in police cells in Polinter until the last week of December, when he was reportedly transferred to Agua Santa prison. However, there are no records of his detention at Agua Santa and the recording sheet of his identity documents in Polinter has gone missing. AI is gravely concerned for his safety."
