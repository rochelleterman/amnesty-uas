 According to Dilshod Kurbanov's lawyer, on 22 January 2008 the Office of the Prosecutor General has taken the decision to extradite Dilshod Kurbanov to Uzbekistan. He would be at risk of incommunicado detention, torture and unfair trial leading to a long prison term, if forcibly returned to Uzbekistan. Both he and Mukhammadsolikh Abutov are wanted in Uzbekistan because the authorities there allege that they are members of banned Islamic organizations and planned to overthrow the country's constitutional order."
