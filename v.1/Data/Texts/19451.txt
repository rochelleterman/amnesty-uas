 Chad: 10,000 at imminent risk of forced eviction | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Around 10,000 people are at risk of forced eviction from Ambatta, in Nâ€™Djamena, the capital city of Chad. The authorities have told people living in the area to leave their homes by the end of the rainy season, around mid-October, to enable the construction of modern houses. The affected people have not been consulted about this decision and have not been offered any alternative housing."
