 NA 
 Due to poor health as a result of hunger-strike, Nikos Maziotis' trial did not take place on 12 January 1993 as scheduled. The court refused his lawyer's request to release him on grounds of ill-health but, based on medical advice, he was later granted exemption from call-up for two years on grounds of ill-health. He was released on 18 January but still faces charges of desertion and insulting the Greek Armed Forces. His health is reportedly still poor although he is now out of danger. "
