 EXTRA 43/94 - USA (Pennsylvania): death penalty: Benjamin Terry | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Benjamin Terry, black, is scheduled to be executed on 16 August 1994. This would be the first execution in Pennsylvania for 32 years. He was sentenced to death for the murder of a white prison guard in March 1979 while serving life imprisonment. He was allegedly delusional at the time and had recently been released from the mental ward at the prison. There are fears that he may be executed even though he has not yet exhausted all avenues of legal appeals, as he currently has no lawyer to represent him."
