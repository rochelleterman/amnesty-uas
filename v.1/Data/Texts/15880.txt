 Belarus: Further information on fear of torture or ill-treatment / possible ""disappearance"": Yuri Zakharenko | Amnesty International 
 The former Minister of the Interior, Yury Zakharenko, has now been missing for more than six months. He             ""disappeared"" at the start of the unofficial presidential elections in May 1999. Amnesty International fears he may have been deliberately targeted by the authorities to     silence a prominent and outspoken member of Belarus's     peaceful opposition.
