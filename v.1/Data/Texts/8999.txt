 Willie Williams, black, is scheduled to be executed on 24 May 1994. He was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a white male by a jury from Harris County, an area well known for its disparate treatment of African Americans in the criminal justice system. Robert West, who is half-white and half-Native American, was sentenced to death in February 1983 for the murder of a white female. He was also sentenced by a Harris Country Jury."
