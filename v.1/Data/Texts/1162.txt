 Anthony Njuguna Njui was arrested on 30 July 1994. His family and lawyers have not been permitted to see him and there are reports that he may have been tortured. The first six men named above were jointly charged with robbery with violence and possesion of firearms on 19 July 1994. All have alleged that they were tortured and the presiding magistrate has ordered that they receive medical treatment before their pleas are heard. AI believes that the charges against Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki and some, if not all, of his co-accused may have been fabricated."
