 Turkmenistan:  Medical action: President announces large-scale closure of  hospitals | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 According to recent press reports, at a meeting on 28 February President Saparmurad Niyazov announced that all hospitals apart from those in the capital should be closed, saying that they were not needed as any citizens requiring health care could travel to Ashgabat, the capital city, and obtain treatment there. This proposal would mean that many ill people would be unable to travel, including those who have suffered a serious accident or emergency health condition, to seek appropriate health care. This document urges health professionals to write to medical associations and medical journals expressing concern."
