 UA 36/93 - Guatemala: threats / harassment: staff of the Asociacion para el Avance de las Ciencias Sociales en Guatemala (AVANCSO) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Staff and associates of AVANSCO, the Association for the Advancement of Social Sciences in Guatemala, have reported intimidation and harassment in recent months. The acts of intimidation appear to be linked to judicial proceedings against army sergeant Noel de Jesus Beteta Alvarez for the killing of one of the founding members of AVANSCO, the anthropologist Myrna Mack Chang. Heavy surveillance was observed around AVANSCO's offices in late 1992. Since then staff have reported being followed and a night porter and Maria Elena Davila de Torres, a cleaner, have been threatened. "
