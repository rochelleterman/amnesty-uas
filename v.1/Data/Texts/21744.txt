 Lebanon: Cluster-bombs threaten civilian lives (Web Update) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The 34-day conflict between Israel and Hizbullah claimed the lives of some 1,000 civilians in Lebanon - about one third of them children. Now hundreds of thousands of unexploded cluster bombs fired by Israeli forces litter the villages of South Lebanon and are killing or injuring civilians every day. UN de-mining experts estimate that it will take years to clear the area."
