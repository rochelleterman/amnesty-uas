 On 8 March 1994 students of the University of Bophuthatswana decided to boycott classes until the authorities agreed to participate in South Africa's elections. At least 40 students were injured when police forced their way onto campus on 9 March. Three students, Kgabo Matlala, Betty Phetoe and Mr Mthunsi, were arrested and their lawyers have since been denied access to them. Some 10 young people were arrested on the night of 8 March by police in Itsoseng. People in the neighbourhood reported hearing their screams from inside the police station and feared the inmates were being tortured. When two human rights lawyers and a journalist tried to gain access to them, they were stopped and threatened by police. By 10 March lawyers had still not been able to gain access, and there is concern for the detainees' safety."
