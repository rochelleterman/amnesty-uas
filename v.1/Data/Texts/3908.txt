 A group of around 100 Guarani Indians reportedly occupied a portion of a ranch situated on historically indigenous territory known as Sombrerito in Mato Grosso do Sul state in the morning of 26 June. Cattle ranchers shot one Indian man dead and injured four others, but the group of 100 Indians are still occupying the land. They have been surrounded by armed cattle ranchers, and have no way to escape: their lives are in grave danger.
