 Cambodia: Condemn forced eviction of Cambodian families | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Some 31 families living with HIV and AIDS in the Borei Keila area of the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, have been forcibly evicted from their homes. Around 20 of the families were taken to a grossly inadequate resettlement site with limited access to health care. On 21 June 2009, three days after the forced eviction of 20 families, the remaining 11 were also evicted after government officials told them they were eligible to rent flats being built in the area."
