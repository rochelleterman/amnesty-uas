 The three men named above, all officials of the opposition Malawi Democratic Party based in exile, were arrested at Kamuzu International Airport on 7 February 1992 as they returned to Malawi after exile in South Africa. They are being held without charge and apparently without access to their families or lawyer in the regional police headquarters. They have been held without charge longer than the 48 hours permitted by law. AI is appealing for their immediate release as prisoners of conscience. "
