 On 10 February, the Bangladeshi security forces prevented members of the Islamist group, the International Khatme Nabuwat Movement (IKNM) from holding a rally at the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat mosque in Dhanikhola village, in Mymensingh, a district of Dhaka Division. However, IKNM leaders have threatened to hold further protests at two Ahmadiyya mosques in the coming months, leading to renewed concern for the safety of the Ahmadiyya religious community.
