 Andre Thelusma and another Haitian (name not known to AI) were detained in Port-au-Prince on 31 July 1994 while accompanying three US journalists who had been covering events for a major US TV news programme. The men are reportedly now held in Fort Dimanche army barracks. The three journalists were also arrested but deported. AI is concerned for the safety of the two Haitians."
