 There is concern for the safety of members of the Msweli family following the killing of Musa Msweli and two other men, and threats made against other members of the family. Musa Msweli was shot dead in unclear circumstances by police on 20 April 1995 together with two other men, Khulekani Nkwanyana and Mbuyiseni Mnguni. A fourth man, name unknown, was injured in the incident. On 18 April police had raided the family home in KwaSokhulu, and allegedly threatened Mrs Mosephinah Msweli and ill-treated her grandchildren, while making inquiries as to the whereabouts of Musa Msweli. Musa Msweli was a former chairman of the local branch of the African National Congress (ANC)."
