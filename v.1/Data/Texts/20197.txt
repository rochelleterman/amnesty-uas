 On 22 February 2008, human rights lawyers Jesús Manuel Grijalva and Gilberto Hernández Santiago received a written death threat. Two days later, human rights defender Alma Gómez Soto was harassed in her home by two unidentified women. These events are apparently in reprisal for their human rights work in Oaxaca. Amnesty International believes their lives may be in danger."
