 OPIM member Rafael Rodriguez Dircio was threatened with death on 4 February by a supporter of the local cacique (political boss) in the community of El Camalote, Guerrero State. Rafael Rodriguez is one of 15 OPIM members who have been accused of the 1 January 2008 killing of Alejandro Feliciano Garc√≠a. Five people named in this action have already been detained. They are prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful opposition to the cacique while defending the rights of members of their indigenous community. "
