 NA 
 On 27 June 1994 Kadri Avdiu was severely beaten and ill-treated by police at Luzane police station. He has temporarily moved away from home, but police have recently searched for him, and on 6 July summoned his brothers to the police station and threatened his brother Shefki that he had three days to bring his brother Kadri to the police. Kadri Avdiu is an ethnic Albanian from Belopoje village near Podujevo in Kosovo. He is chairman of a local branch of the opposition party the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK). There are fears that if he is located by the police, he and his brothers risk further ill-treatment."
