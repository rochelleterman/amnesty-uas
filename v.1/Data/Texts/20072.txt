 Guatemala: Death Penalty: Proposed resumption of executions | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 12 February 2008 the Congress of Guatemala approved Decree 06-2008, known as the “Law regulating the commuting of sentence for those condemned to death”, which established a procedure for those condemned to death to request a pardon from the President. Decree 06-2008 effectively leaves open the possibility of executions to resume after a prolonged de facto moratorium due to the absence of the presidential pardon facility."
