 Soheila Ghadiri's death sentence was quashed in October 2008. She had been sentenced to death for the murder of her five-day-old son, and has been pardoned by the child's father. As she has been pardoned, she no longer faces the death sentence. She is to be retried for murder and can be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment. Amnesty International has no further information on the other four women named in this action."
