 At least 200 people are still detained in the Gaza Strip, after a crackdown by the ruling Hamas de facto administration on political activists and armed militia members affiliated with the Fatah party. Detainees are held incommunicado without their legal rights and many are believed to have been tortured. More people face being detained and tortured in the coming days. "
