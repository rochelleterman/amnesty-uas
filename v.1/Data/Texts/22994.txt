 Yemen: Political activist detained incommunicado | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A leader of a political opposition group in southern Yemen has been held in incommunicado detention since 9 November 2010. Amnesty International fears for Hassan Ba’oom’s health and is concerned that he may be held solely for the peaceful expression of his right to freedom of expression and therefore a prisoner of conscience.
