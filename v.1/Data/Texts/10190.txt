 Venezuela: fear for safety/Fear of refoulement: | Amnesty International 
 Some 700 Colombian refugees, who fled paramilitary        killings and death threats, are reportedly about to be    forcibly returned from Venezuela. A Venezuelan army       general has apparently told journalists that their return to Colombia is ""imminent"" (""inminente""), possibly through the Venezuelan border town of Puerto Santander. There are serious fears for their safety.
