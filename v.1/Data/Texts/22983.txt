 Ismail Lutef Huraish and his cousin Ali Mussara’a Muhammad Huraish are at risk of imminent execution. They have exhausted all their appeal stages, and their death sentences were ratified by the President. They could be executed as early as next week. Another man, Hammoud Ahmed Qaid Sa’eed, who was detained with the two men in Ta’iz prison, was executed today, despite medical evidence showing that he was mentally ill."
