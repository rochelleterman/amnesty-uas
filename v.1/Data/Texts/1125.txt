 On 23 June 1994 the charges of subversion against the four journalists named above were dropped and replaced with a more serious charge of sedition. They were released on bail with no date set for a trial. Two other journalists, however, Bedan Mbugua and David Makali, are currently in prison serving sentences of three and five months respectively on a charge of contempt of court after an article in the The People magazine criticized a judgement in the Court of Appeal. Both journalists are prisoners of conscience."
