 On 17 December 2007, peaceful advocates of political reform Walid al-Bunni and Yasser al-â€˜Eiti were arrested and are reportedly held incommunicado without charge at State Security branch in Damascus. A total of seven political activists are now thought to be held by State Security and are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Amnesty International considers them to be probable prisoners of conscience, detained solely for their peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association."
