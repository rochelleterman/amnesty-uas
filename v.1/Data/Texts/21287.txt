 The Bulgarian authorities are preparing to forcibly return Said Kadzoev to the Russian Federation where he would be at serious risk of torture and other ill-treatment. If he is forcibly returned, Bulgaria will be violating its obligations under international human rights law which expressly prohibit the return of anyone to a country where they would be at risk of torture."
