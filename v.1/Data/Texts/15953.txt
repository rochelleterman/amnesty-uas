 Boris Dekanidze was sentenced to death in November 1994 for ordering the murder of an investigative journalist. In February 1995 the Lithuanina Supreme Court decided not to review his sentence. On 11 May the President rejected his final appeal for clemency. There are fears that his execution may be imminent although no date has been set."
