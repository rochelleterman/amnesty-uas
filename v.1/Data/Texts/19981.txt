 Cuba: Parents of dead Cuban activist harassed | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 18 February 2011 Reina Luisa Tamayo, and her husband Jos√© Ortiz, were arrested and detained for 12 hours by state security agents. Reina Tamayo is the mother of Cuban prisoner of conscience Orlando Zapata who died last year, having spent several weeks on hunger strike whilst in prison. Amnesty International believes that their detention is an attempt to prevent them from undertaking any activities in memory of Orlando Zapata on the first anniversary of his death on 23 February."
