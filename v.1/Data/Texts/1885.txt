 Rwanda: death penalty: Captain David Rwapapa, Second Lieutenant Innocent Ngoga | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 11 May 1995 two officers of the Rwandese Patriotic Army (RPA) were sentenced to death by court martial. Captain David Rwapapa and Second Lieutenant Innocent Ngoga were found guilty of involvement in an attack in late 1994 on the Tanzanian Embassy in Kigali, during which two nightguards were killed. There are fears that their death sentences, the first passed by a military tribunal since the present government came to power, may herald a widespread use of the death penalty throughout Rwanda's military and civilian courts."
