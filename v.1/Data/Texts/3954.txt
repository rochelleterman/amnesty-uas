 NA 
 Luiz Francisco Fartas Moura, an active member of the Rural Workers Union (STR) in Buriti, Bico do Papagaio, Tocantins state, has reportedly been informed by local police that he is at the top of a hit list of local gunmen (pistoleiros). They are apparently acting on behalf of local landowners, who allege that he made an attempt on the life of a rancher believed to have ordered the killing of Father Josimo Morais Tavares, coordinator of the Pastoral Land Commission in Tocantinopolis diocese, in 1987. Luiz Francisco Fartas Moura worked closely with Father Josimo; he is still active in the Catholic Church. AI is concerned for his safety. "
