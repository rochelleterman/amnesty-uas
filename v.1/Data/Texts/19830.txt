 Brother Henri de Rosiers, a priest,  has been named on a  ""death list"" drawn up by a   death squad believed to      operate with the acquiescence of  the police. Amnesty     International believes that he and    the other church    mission staff, Anilson Russi, Ana de Sousa Pinto and      Airton dos Reis Perreira, are in grave   danger."
