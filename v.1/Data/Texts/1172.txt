 The judgement in the trial of Koigi wa Wamwere and his three co-defendants is due on 25 September 1995. All four face mandatory death sentences if convicted.  AI believes that the charges against them have been fabricated and that the real reason for their arrest is their criticism of the government. AI considers all four to be prisoners of conscience."
