 EXTRA 21/93 - Bosnia-Herzegovina: fear for safety: non-Serbs in the Serbian-controlled town of Banja Luka | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about the apparently worsening situation for non-Serbs in Banja Luka in the past few weeks. Frequent incidents of violence against Muslims and Croats by irregular soldiers and civilians have been reported. On 28 February 1993 a Croatian house was allegedly bombed, injuring 9 people, including two children. On 27 February a Muslim woman was reportedly raped by Serb irregulars who were robbing her house. Large numbers of non-Serb men have been called up to serve in the Bosnian Serb army; refusal to comply reportedly results in beatings. These abuses occur with the apparent complicity of the local Serb authorities. "
