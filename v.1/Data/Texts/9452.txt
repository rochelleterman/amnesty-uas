 Joe Louis Wise Sr is scheduled to be executed in Virginia, USA, on 14 September 1993. Joe Wise, black, was sentenced to death in December 1984 for the murder during a robbery of William Ricketson, white, in December 1983. According to his present lawyer, he was represented at trial by an inexperienced state-appointed lawyer, who failed to provide evidence at his trial relating to his deprived background, which, if presented, may have resulted in a lesser sentence.
