 Guatemala: threats / intimidation: Jose Ruben Zamora Marroquin | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about reports that on 13 February 1995 Jose Ruben Zamora Marroquin, director of the Guatemalan newspaper Siglo Veintiuno, was followed and threatened. Siglo Veintiuno played an important role in publicizing developments during the attempted auto-golpe of 1993. Since then, staff members have periodically been subjected to threats and harassment."
