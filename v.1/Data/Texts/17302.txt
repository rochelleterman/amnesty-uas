 Iran: Further information on medical concern/ possible prisoners of conscience/ Fear of torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Ma'soumeh Ka'bi and her four-year-old son Imad were reportedly released on 28 April after payment of bail. The other women and children (Soghra Khudayrawi and her son Zeidan, aged 4; Sakina Naisi, aged 40; Hoda Hawashem, aged 24 and her sons Ossama, aged 2 and Ahmad, aged 4) are reportedly still in custody, but there is no further information about them. They appear to be held solely in an attempt to force their husbands and fathers to give themselves up to the authorities. If so they are prisoners of conscience.
