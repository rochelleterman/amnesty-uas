 Omar Mohammed Khalifa, aged about 36, and a number of other Libyan nationals in US custody in Guantænamo Bay, Cuba, are feared to be at risk of forcible transfer to Libya. There they could face prolonged incommunicado detention without charge, putting them at serious risk of torture and other ill-treatment. They could also be at risk of unfair trials.
