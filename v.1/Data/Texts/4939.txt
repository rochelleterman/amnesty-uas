 UA 263/93 - Colombia: fear for safety: About 150 human rights workers, trade unionists and grassroots leaders. | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Military intelligence in Colombia has compiled a list of some 150 individuals and institutions whom, it claims, are collaborators or supporters of guerilla groups. This list has been passed to Q.A.P., a Colombian television station which intends to broadcast the list shortly. There is concern that publication will put the individuals' lives at risk and will damage both their reputation and that of any organization with which they are associated. In recent years trade unionists, human rights workers and popular leaders have been a particular target for human rights violations. Laywers from the Colombian office of the Andean Commission of Jurists have presented an accion de tutela to the courts, which calls for the prevention of publication by QAP or any other public media.
