 United Arab Emirates (UAE): Further information on imminent flogging / possible prisoner of conscience and new concern: prisoner of conscience: Elie Dib Ghalib | Amnesty International 
 Elie Dib Ghalib's sentence of 39 lashes was not carried out on 16 November 1996 and he is reported to have expressed intent to convert to Islam. Amnesty International believes that the above, a 29-year-old Lebanese Christian and restaurant manager, is a prisoner of conscience imprisoned because of his marriage as a Christian to a Muslim woman.
