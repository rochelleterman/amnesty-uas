 UA 267/93 - Morocco: death penalty: First known execution in eleven years, Mohamed Tabet | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Mohamed Tabet was executed by firing squad at dawn in Kenitra Central Prison on 9 August 1993. This was the first execution known to have been carried out since 1982. Mohamed Tabet was police commissioner and head of the Renseignements generaux (Information Service) for the Ain Sebaa/Hay Mohammedi district of Casablanca. He was convicted at Casablanca Criminal Court on 15 March of rape and violence against up to 1,600 women. The death sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court on 5 August. While appreciating the outrage that crimes such as those committed by Mohamed Tabet provoke, Amnesty International unconditionally opposes the death penalty in all cases as the ultimate form of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and a violation of the right to life.
