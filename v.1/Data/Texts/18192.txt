 Palestinian Authority: Fear of imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that between 30 and 50 prisoners who are held on death row in Palestinian Authority (PA) prisons are at risk of execution. On 12 June, PA President Mahmoud Abbas authorized the execution of four prisoners. These were the first executions to be carried out by the PA since August 2002.
