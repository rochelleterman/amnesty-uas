 Reynolds Georges, a former Senator who until recently had supported the de facto military rulers of Haiti, was shot and wounded in a attack on 1 August 1994. The attack was reportedly carried out by a carload of police and soldiers firing automatic weapons. He was badly wounded but has been unable to seek medical treatment as the authorities are apparently searching for him and his family. The attack came days after he had publicly criticized General Cedras and his backers on CNN television and in the foreign press."
