 The five people named above were executed on 20 May 1993. There is concern that they were executed less than two months after the criminal incident for which they were convicted. The five men, all common law prisoners, were found guilty of setting fire to al-Hasaka Prison on 24 March 1993, causing the death of 57 inmates and injuries to other prisoners. "
