 AI has learned with concern of the arrest and detention of Mohamed Latheef who has reportedly been in solitary confinement since his arrest on 25 August 1995. There is grave concern, given his age, about his health. It is not known whether he has received any medical treatment while in detention. His arrest may be linked to that of Ahamed Shafeeq and Ali Moosa Didi. To date none of the three have been charged or brought before a court."
