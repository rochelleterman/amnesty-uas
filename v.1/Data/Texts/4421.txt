They had been detained on 12 January 1993 by members of the army's Mobile Brigade no. 2 but their detention was subsequently denied. Ramon Villegas is reportedly still held by the army but the circumstances of his detention are not clear. Luis Ernesto Ascanio (no relation to Luis Alfonso Ascanio), aged 15, has not been seen since 26 January 1993. His family were reportedly being held hostage by the Mobile Brigade no. 2 at the time. His mother and the other younger children have managed to leave the area. "
