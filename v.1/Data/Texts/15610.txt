 Russian Federation: Further information on Fear of forcible return/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 It is now clear that the Uzbekistani authorities have based their request for the extradition from Russia of the 14 men on accusations that they were involved in the events in the eastern Uzbekistani city of Andizhan on 13 May, when hundreds of people were reportedly killed when the security forces opened fire on demonstrators in the city. They have also accused the 14 of involvement in a religious extremist group which they call Akramia, and of financing ""terrorist"" activities. All 14 men reportedly deny these accusations. There is good reason to believe that anyone accused of involvement in the 13 May events in Andizhan is at risk of serious human rights violations, including torture and unfair trials leading to long prison terms or even the death penalty, if returned to Uzbekistan.
