"Colombia: Fear for safety: Angel Augusto Trujillo Sogamoso 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Angel Augusto Trujillo Sogamoso, a former guerrilla now working with military intelligence, who has publicly denounced serious human rights violations carried out by the security forces in collaboration with paramilitary forces. In the past, witnesses and those who have denounced such links between the security forces and the paramilitaries have frequently been victims themselves of serious human rights violations.
