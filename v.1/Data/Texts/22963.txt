 Yemen: Imminent execution: Ahmed ‘Abdul Salaam ‘Abdullah Qassim (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ahmed ‘Abdul Salaam ‘Abdullah Qassim, who was sentenced to death in December 2005 for murder, has had all his appeals rejected. Now President ‘Ali ‘Abdullah Saleh must decide whether to ratify his sentence or commute it to a term of imprisonment. Ahmed ‘Abdul Salaam ‘Abdullah Qassim is therefore in imminent danger of execution."
