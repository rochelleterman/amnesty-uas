 AI has learned that Olance Nogueras Roce was rearrested on the evening of 26 October in Havana and is believed to be detained in Ariza Prsion in Cienfuegos. He has been arrested three times in the past few weeks. Apart from the previous threats of being charged with ""dangerousness"", one so far unconfirmed report suggests that he may be charged with ""enemy propaganda"" because of an article he wrote regarding safety fears at the Cuban nuclear power station in Juagua, near Cienfuegos."
