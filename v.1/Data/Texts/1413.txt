 UA 21/94 - Mauritania: legal concern / prisoner of conscience: Cheikh Saad Bouh Kamara | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is serious concern at the arrest of human rights activist, Professor Cheikh Saad Bouh Kamara, in Nouakchott, on 20 January 1994. He is Professor of Sociology at the University of Nouakchott and Vice-President of an independent human rights organization, l'Association Mauritanienne des Droits de l'Homme (AMDH). He was arrested at his home, reportedly without a warrrant, by plainclothes police, who searched his house and confiscated papers relating to his human rights work. In the days preceding his arrest, he had met with members of a joint international human rights delegation including representatives of the International Human Rights Federation (FIDH) and Agir Ensemble pour les Droits de l'Homme. A prisoner of conscience, he is currently held incommunicado at Police Headquarters in Nouakchott."
