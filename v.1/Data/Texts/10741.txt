 A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman confirmed on 25 May 1993 that the two Lhasa residents, Gendun Rinchen and Lobsang Yonten were detained for political activities. The two men were reportedly involved in monitoring human rights violations in Tibet prior to the arrival in Lhasa of a delegation of European Community (EC) diplomats on 16 May 1993. The authorities have not disclosed where they are being held, and it is feared they may be ill-treated. On 24 and 25 May, just after the diplomats' departure, major protests took place involving up to 2,000 people. It is feared further arbitrary arrests may be carried out as a result of these protests.
