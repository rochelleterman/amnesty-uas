 Another member of the Adana Branch of HADEP has been killed. Haci Sait Macir, a member of Hadep in Yuregir and the owner of a cafeteria in Adana, was shot dead on 30 December 1994. He died on 1 January 1995 from his wounds. His wife has stated that her husband had often been harassed by the police before his death. At his funeral, police took the name and home address of Mehmet Turmus, a board member of HADEP in Seyhan, Adana. They appeared at his address a couple of days later. There are now grave fears for the safety of Mehmet Turmus."
