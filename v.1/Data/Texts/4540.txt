 NA 
 There are fears for the safety of Efrain Viveros, after he was shot repeatedly by two heavily-armed men at his home in Cali, Valle del Cauca department, on 9 February 1994. Local metropolitan police agents have stated that the arms used in the attack are used exclusively by the Colombian armed forces. Efrain Viveros is a local trade union leader and member of the left-wing coalition party, Union Patriotica (UP), Patriotic Union. He stood as a UP candidate at the last elections, and has also acted as an advisor to UP leader Aida Abella, herself the victim of continual harassment and death threats."
