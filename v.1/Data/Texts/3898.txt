 Three public prosecutors at the Military Courts of Sao Paulo are reported to have been receiving death threats because of their work to prosecute military police officers implicated in the so-called ""House of Detentions massacre"" in October 1992. The threats are reportedly related to the prosecutors' public statements in favour of transferring certain human rights crimes from the military to the civilian courts. The three public prosecutors named above, especially Dr Stella Kuhlmann, have previously received death threats."
