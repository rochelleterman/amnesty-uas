On 18 April 1999 the Supreme Military Court issued its    verdict in the so-called ""Returnees from Albania"" trial.  None of the above has been given the death sentence       despite demands by the prosecution for this. Ahmad        Ibrahim al-Sayyid al-Naggar is, however, still at risk of imminent execution as a result of an outstanding death    sentence from a previous trial (see EXTRA 53/98).
