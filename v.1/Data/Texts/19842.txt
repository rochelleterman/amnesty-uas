 Brazil: Indigenous group attacked by armed men | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Around ten armed men attacked the Guarani Kaiowa ApykaÂ´y community near Dourados, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Shots were fired indiscriminately at the community's encampment, a shack was set alight and members of the community were physically and verbally threatened. The Indigenous group, who have been camped by the side of the highway since being evicted from their ancestral lands in April 2009, fear further violence."
