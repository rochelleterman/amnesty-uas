 Viet Nam: Fear for safety/torture/ill-treatment/arbitrary detention: Bui Thi Kim Thanh (f)

 | Amnesty International 
 Lawyer Bui Thi Kim Thanh is being held against her will at a mental hospital, in very poor conditions, where she is reportedly being forced to have injections of unknown drugs. There is apparently no medical basis for this, and it is believed to be an attempt by the authorities to punish her for her work on behalf of an unauthorised pro-democracy organisation.
