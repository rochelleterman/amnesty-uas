 Colombia: ""disappearance"" / fear for safety: John Ricardo Ubate Monroy, Gloria Bogota (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is serious concern for the safety of John Ricardo Ubate Monroy and Gloria Bogota, whose whereabouts have been unknown since they were abducted on 19 May 1995 in Cali, Valle department. A number of people witnessed the abduction and one woman called the police, who pursued the abductor's car. However, when the police had almost caught up the the car they reportedly received an order from a high-ranking police official to halt the pursuit. Relatives of the victims reportedly believe that the judicial and administrative authorities of Cali are reluctant to investigate the case, giving the impression that they do not want to confront the official who gave the order to halt pursuit, therby protecting those responsible for these ""disappearances""."
