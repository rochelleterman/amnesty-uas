 Italy: Further Information on Fear of imminent forced eviction | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Around 30 people belonging to seven families from the Sinti (Roma) community in the village of Gamboloâ€™ in the province of Pavia, Italy, are still facing an imminent forced eviction. This is despite the last eviction order being suspended by an emergency decision from the Administrative Tribunal of the region of Lombardia on 30 April 2009. The matter is not settled and the Sinti community is still under threat of forced eviction."
