 NA 
 Guillermo Chen’s house was shot at six times on the evening of 5 March 2008. He is director of the non-governmental organization Fundación Nueva Esperanza, Río Negro (New Hope Foundation, Río Negro), which campaigns for justice for crimes committed during Guatemala’s internal armed conflict (1960-1996). Amnesty International believes that Guillermo Chen's life, and the lives of his wife and children, may be at risk."
