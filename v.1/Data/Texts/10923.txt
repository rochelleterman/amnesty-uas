 People's Republic of China: Further information on arbitrary arrest / fear for safety: Hongda Harry Wu | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Chinese authorities announced on 8 July 1995 that human rights activist Harry Wu had formally been arrested by the Wuhan Public Security Bureau (police) and accused of stealing state secrets, disseminating those secrets to bodies outside China and attempting to enter China under a false name. AI considers him to be a prisoner of conscience and is calling for his immediate and unconditional release. AI believes his arrest to be related to his involvement in publicizing information about political imprisonment and human rights abuses in China."
