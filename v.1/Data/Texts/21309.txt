 Italy: Roma evicted from settlements in Rome | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Residents in at least three unauthorized Roma settlements in Rome have been evicted, continuing what seems to be a wave of forced evictions in the Italian capital. According to local NGOs, more than 30 settlements have been evicted since the beginning of April. There are fears that residents in other Roma settlements in the city are at imminent risk of eviction."
