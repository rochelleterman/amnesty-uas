 The man known to the Pakistani authorities as Manjit Singh, whom relatives claim is Sarabjit Singh, is due to be executed on 30 April 2008. Previously his execution date had been set for 1 April, but he was granted a one-month stay following appeals for clemency from the Indian government and mounting public pressure in India."
