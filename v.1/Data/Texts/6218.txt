 There is concern at reports of two recent incidents of police violence against street youths in Guatemala City. On 14 March 1994 Luis Aroldo Vasquez was shot and wounded after he and two others were approached by three uniformed police, who threatened the youths and demanded money. On 3 March 1994 Luis Antonio Roldan, Francisco Tziac Soc and Myriam Eugenia Fuentes were reportedly assaulted by uniformed police."
