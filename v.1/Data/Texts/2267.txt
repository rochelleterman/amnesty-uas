 UA 207/93 - South Africa: fear of extrajudicial execution: Sam Nxumalo, Sipho Mthiyane, Lucky Mthiyane | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Sam Nxumalo, Chairperson of the ANC branch in the Eshowe area of northern Natal has received death threats at public meetings and in anonymous phone calls, and threatening conduct towards him by two members of the South African Police (SAP) on 8 June 1993. There is also concern for the safety of Sipho Mthiyane, an Induna (senior councillor to the chief), and his son Lucky Mthiyane, who were shot and stabbed by a person suspected to be a member of the Kwazulu Police (KZP) on 18 May 1993. There is concern that police are failing to respond to calls for assistance in an impartial manner, and in certain cases are directly implicated in the violence. "
