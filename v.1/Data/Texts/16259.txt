 The Supreme Court trial of the above-named ended on 31 March 1995. All were found guilty of charges including conspiracy to seize power and calling for the violent overthrow of the state. The six male defendants received sentences of up to 12 years in prison; Dilarom Iskhakova, female, received a sentence of six years, suspended for three years. AI believes that this may not have been a fair trial as confessions possibly made under torture may have been used by the prosecution."
