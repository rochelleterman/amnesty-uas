 Iran: Arbitrary arrest/ Detention without charge | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Brothers Arash Alaei and Kamiar Alaei, both of whom are doctors specialising in the prevention and management of HIV and AIDS, were arrested in June 2008. They are believed to be held without charge in Tehran's Evin Prison. E’temad newspaper in Iran has reported that the brothers are held on ""suspicion of plotting to overthrow the government"". Amnesty International fears their arrest may be politically motivated and based on the brothers’ association with non governmental organizations based in the US."
