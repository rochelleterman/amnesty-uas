 Venezuela: Further information on: Fear for safety/Death threats | Amnesty International 
 On 18 June, an attempt was made on the life of Oscar Barrios as he left the house of the widow of Luis Barrios who was allegedly killed by the police in September 2004. This is the most recent in a series of attacks, threats and acts of intimidations against the Barrios family since they filed a complaint about the police killing of Narciso Barrios in 2003. Members of the family have been detained by police several times and Amnesty International believes that they are in grave danger.
