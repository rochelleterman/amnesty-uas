 Louis Sibeko, general secretary of the Thokoza Civic Association, was arrested in a pre-dawn police raid on his home on 17 August 1993. Eleven others, named above, were arrested shortly after. All twelve are being held at Boksburg Prison udner emergency regulations, which permit detention without charge or trial for 30 days, and access to the detainee is at the discretion of the police authorities. On 19 August a human rights monitor visiting the prison saw police taking Louis Sibeko to a hospital, which police refused to name. He was reportedly suffering pains in the chest and abdomen. The police have reportedly returned him to prison. Human rights monitors are still trying to gather more information about the other detainees. "
