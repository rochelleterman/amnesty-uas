 Members of AI's Urgent Action network have received official replies about this action from the Ambassador of Turkmenistan in Washington. The Ambassador calims that Yusup Kuliyev, reported to have ""disappeared"", had not been arrested and was at home in Ashgabat. However, unofficial sources maintain that he had been detained for around 15 days and that, although he is now at home, he remains under supervision by law enforcement authorities."
