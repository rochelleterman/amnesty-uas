 EXTRA 81/92 - Turkey: death threats: Ismail Yilmaz | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ismail Yilmaz has been receiving death threats ever since he made a complaint of torture against three policemen whom he identified and who have been indicted for the alleged torture. The police have allegedly tried to get him to withdraw his complaint and there have been two recent incidences of his narrowly escaping death when a car has been driven towards him. The police have also visited his wife's nephew, reportedly telling him to encourage Ismail Yilmaz to give up the case. An investigation into the threats against Ismail Yilmaz has been opened. "
