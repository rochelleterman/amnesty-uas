 The two men named above are reported to be in incommunicado detention in the State Security Headquarters in Abu Dhabi. They were arrested in mid-January following rainds on their homes in Sharjah, in which some of their books, documents and personal papers were confiscated. AI is concerned that they may have been arrested solely for the non-violent expression of their beliefs; the organization is seeking clarification of the reasons for their arrest and the charges brought against them. AI is concerned that they might face torture in incommunicado detention and that Shekih 'Abd al-Mun'im al-'Ali, an Iraqi national in exile in the UAE since 1980, may be sent back to Iraq."
