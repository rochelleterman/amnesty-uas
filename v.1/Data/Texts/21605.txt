 Lithuania: Parliament moves to criminalize homosexuality: Urgent – Act Now! | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 14 July 2009, the Lithuanian Parliament (the Seimas) adopted a “Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effect of Public Information”, despite an earlier Presidential veto. This law bans materials that “agitate for homosexual, bisexual and polygamous relations” from schools or public places and media where they could be viewed by children. It enters into force on 1 March 2010. Amnesty International is seriously concerned that the proposed amendment to the Penal Code would criminalize almost any public expression or portrayal of, or information about, homosexuality. "
