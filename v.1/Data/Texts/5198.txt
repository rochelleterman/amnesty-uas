 The new government of President Samper which took office on 7 August 1994 has to date failed to take a firm stance against former President Gaviria's objections to the draft law against ""disappearance"". The Ministers of Defence, Interior and Foreign Relations have been invited to attend a plenary session of the Senate of the Colombian Congress on 21 September, and it is hoped that they will attend the meeting and firmly reject the former President's objections."
