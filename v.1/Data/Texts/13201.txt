 UA 361/92 - Philippines: death threats / harassment: Eduardo Faelnar | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Eduardo Faelnar, a messenger for the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) in Cagayan de Oro City, has reportedly been subjected to death threats and other harassment since October 1992. The intimidation is believed to be carried out by military officials and civilians working with them. He has been warned that the military want to ""eliminate"" him. Members of the local Military Intelligence Command briefly detained him in October and warned him that his name would be included in a list of alleged members of the outlawed New People's Army wanted by the military. Eduardo Faelner has reported being followed and kept under surveillance during the last few weeks. "
