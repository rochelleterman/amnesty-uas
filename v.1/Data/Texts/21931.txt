 Ali Saremi (or Sarami) was executed without warning on 28 December 2010 in Evin Prison, Tehran. He had been sentenced to death in December 2009 for “enmity against God” for his alleged membership of a banned opposition group, the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI). Seven other people with alleged links to the same organization are also under sentence of death. All their trials are believed to have been unfair."
