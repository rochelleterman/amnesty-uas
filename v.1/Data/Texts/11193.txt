 UA 128/93 - India: fear of torture / ""disappearance"": Gulshan Singh | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Gulshan Singh was last seen at around 10 pm on 3 April 1993, being taken away from a Sikh temple in north-west Delhi by men in plainclothes. His father has made inquiries with the Lt. Governor of Delhi, the Commissioner of Police and the Home Secretary but has received so far no reply. Gulshan Singh was released on bail from prison in June 1992; he was serving a sentence in connection with a bomb attack on a government minister. He has been under surveillance ever since. The authorities deny holding him but reports suggest that he is being held for interrogation in Punjab. AI is concerned for his safety. "
