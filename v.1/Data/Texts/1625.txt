 UA 282/94 - Nigeria: prisoner of conscience / health concern: Bashorun (Chief) Moshood K O Abiola | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Bashorun Moshood K.O. Abiola, widely believed to be the undeclared winner of the 1993 presidential elections, was charged with ""treasonable felony"" in the High Court in Abuja on 6 July. He had been arrested in Lagos by hundreds of armed police on 23 June and had been detained incommunicado until his appearance in court on 6 July, despite several habeas corpus orders. He has been held in Gashua prison in the far north of Nigeria, where conditions are harsh. He suffers from hypertension and has apparently been denied appropriate medical care. He is a prisoner of conscience."
