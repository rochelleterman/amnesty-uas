 UA 421/93 - Singapore: death penalty: Fung Yuk Shing | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Fung Yuk Shing, aged 22, from Hong Kong, was sentenced to death on 5 December 1992 for drug trafficking. He has claimed that he did not know the exact nature of the substance he was carrying, and that his life and that of his family had been threatened if he did not carry it. His appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was rejected on 27 August 1993, and his last hope of clemency now resides with President Ong Teng Cheong."
