 Sudan: Possible prisoners of conscience / fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Moneim Attia, engineer, Nagib Nejm al-Din, aged 46, medical doctor: AI has received reports that the above were arrested in Khartoum on 8 and 13 July 1996 respectively. Neither man has been brought to a court or charged. The arrests of Nagib Nejm al-Din, who was Secretary General of the Sudan Doctors' Union at the time of the 1989 coup that brought the current government to power, and Moneim Attia, who was previously detained in 1990, appear to be part of a clampdown on persons suspected of supporting the banned National Democratic Alliance. AI is concerned that they may be prisoners of conscience and that they are at risk of ill-treatment.
