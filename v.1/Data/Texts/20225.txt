 On 14 April 2008 Ireneo Mujica Zarate, a photographer and a migrants' rights activist, was followed and intimidated as he left a migrants' refuge in Arriaga.  Amnesty International believes that he is at risk of reprisals for his work documenting the beating and possible rape of irregular migrants."
