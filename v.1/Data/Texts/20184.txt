 On 9 January, Chiapas state police officers shot at a van carrying around 45 undocumented migrants in San Cristobal de las Casas Municipality. Three of the migrants were killed and a further eight were seriously injured. Amnesty International fears that the migrants who have testified against those responsible for the attack may be at risk of reprisals. "
