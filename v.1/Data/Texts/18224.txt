 Palestinian Authority: Death penalty/Legal concern - Raji Saqir. | Amnesty International 
 Raji Saqir was put on trial on the night of 2 July and    sentenced to death for the murder of Ahlam Duqmaq the     next day. The proceedings, before the State Security      Court, did not meet even minimum standards for fair       trial. President Yasser Arafat has the power to commute   the      death sentence, which has been passed to him for          ratification, or order a retrial.
