 Malaysia: Further information on  Fear of torture or ill-treatment /             incommunicado         detention /   prisoners of          conscience | Amnesty International 
 Some of the ten detainees held without charge under the Internal Security Act (ISA) have been allowed visits from their families. Police were present during all or part of the visits, and the detainees were unable or unwilling to speak freely. Amnesty International believes the detainees may have been subjected to intense psychological pressure amounting to torture, and continues to be concerned for their safety.
