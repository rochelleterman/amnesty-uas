 Cambodia: Families risk forcible eviction in Phnom Penh | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Up to 1,500 families living around Boeung Kak Lake in Phnom Penh are facing imminent forced eviction, as the local authority and the company developing the land seek to clear the area. Intimidation and threats have been used against villagers to coerce them into accepting inadequate compensation or resettlement, and the security forces have used unnecessary force against peaceful gatherings of protesters."
