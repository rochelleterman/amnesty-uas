 Syria: Possible prisoner of conscience/torture and        ill-treatment/medical concern, Hassan Watfi | Amnesty International 
 Human rights activist Hassan Watfi was reportedly arrested in the early hours of 16 March 2004 by political security officers. He is held at the Military Intelligence Centre in the capital, Damascus, and it seems that he is held incommunicado. This puts him in grave danger of torture and other ill-treatment.
