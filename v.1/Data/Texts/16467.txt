 On 13 December 1994 police reportedly entered a building where pupils of the Architect Sinani secondary school in Kosovska Mitrovica were having lessons. The pupils were ordered to leave. The police then reportedly beat teacher Rexhep Ahmeti and forced him to burn a sociology book by a Croatian author. They also beat another teacher, Bujar Naxhiu, and forced the English teacher, Luljeta Sefaja, to burn an English text-book. The next day, police reportedly entered a house where pupils of another secondary school were being taught. They reportedly beat and ill-treated teacher Sami Rama and reportedly hit maths teacher Avdie Haxhiu."
