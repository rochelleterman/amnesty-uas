 India: Further information on Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 There are grave concerns for the safety of land rights activist John Abraham. Two other activists were shot dead by police at a protest march on 25 June, in an apparent extrajudicial execution: those arrested after the march apparently overheard police officers discussing the killings, saying that the ""other one"" - John Abraham - was still ""remaining"" and that he would be taken care of next.
