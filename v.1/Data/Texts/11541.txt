"Indonesia: Fear of imminent execution 
 Indonesia: Fear of imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that Fabianus Tibo (m) aged 60, Dominggus da Silva (m) also known as Domi, aged 42 and Marinus Riwu (m) aged 48 may face imminent execution after their appeal for clemency was rejected by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on 10 November. Amnesty International is also concerned about reports indicating that the trial of the three men in Palu District Court did not meet international standards of fairness. In particular, there are concerns that witness testimony provided as evidence by the defence may have been ignored by the Court when giving its verdict.
