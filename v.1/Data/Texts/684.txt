 Equatorial Guinea: Fear for safety/fear of torture/medical concern
 | Amnesty International 
 Marcelino Nguema Esono (m), age 40-45, teacher; Jer—nimo Mb‡ Obama (m); Jos_ Antonio Nguema (m); Leoncio (m) were arrested on 27 June, in the city of Bata. At least two are former members of a banned opposition party whose leader is alleged to have plotted to overthrow the government: they are detained incommunicado, and all are at risk of torture. One of them was shot during the arrest, and Amnesty International fears that he could die unless he receives urgent medical treatment.
