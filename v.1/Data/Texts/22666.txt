 Saudi Arabia: Death sentences/Flogging | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Edison Gonzales, Rolando Manaloto Gonzales and Eduardo Arcilla have been sentenced to death, and Victoriano Alfonso, Efren Francisco Dimaun, Omar Basillo and Joel Sinamban have been sentenced to imprisonment and flogging, in the same case and after an unfair trial. The seven, all Filipino nationals, are appealing against their sentences. If their appeals are rejected, and the King confirms the death sentences, three of the men could face imminent execution and the four others could be flogged within weeks."
