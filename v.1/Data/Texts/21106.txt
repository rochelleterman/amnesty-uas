 The Phnom Penh Municipal Court today dismissed Group 78â€™s request for an injunction to stop the forced eviction of their community. A forced eviction could take place at any time. On 20 April 2009, the Phnom Penh Municipality issued a sixth and final eviction notification to the community of around 80 families, giving them 15 days to dismantle their homes and move out of the area.
