 A judge has issued a new order to evict the 468 families who have been living in the derelict Prestes Maia building in central S¨o Paulo for over two years. The municipal authorities must carry out the order before 4 March. Amnesty International is concerned that they are not going to provide secure tenure in adequate alternative accommodation for the families.
