 There is continued concern about the whereabouts and legal status of Jebari Boujemaa who was arrested in Tebessa on 25 February 1994 and faces imminent forcible return (refoulement) to Tunisia. The seven other people named above have reportedly been forcibly returned to Tunisia, possibly as early as 10 February. All eight are recognized as refugees in need of protection by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Despite repeated requests to the authorities, the UNHCR has still been unable to confirm the whereabouts of any of the above people."
