 Seyyid Ja'far al-'Alawi was moved from Jaw Prison No 1 to al-Qal'a Prison about a month ago. He is being held incommunicado and may be subjected to torture. He was apparently transferred after going on a hunger-strike and encouraging others to do the same. He was sentenced to life imprisonment after an unfair trial, following his part in an alleged coup attempt in 1981."
