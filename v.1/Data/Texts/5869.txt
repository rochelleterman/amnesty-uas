 UA 175/93 - El Salvador: abduction / torture / attempted killing: Gregorio Menjia Espinoza | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Gregorio Menjia following his abduction, torture and attempted killing by unidentified armed civilians on 23 May 1993 in San Salvador. Gregorio Menjia, secretary general of the Tonacatepeque branch of the Movimiento Popular Social Cristiano (part of the Democratic Convergence), was forced by armed civilians into a car as he was walking down a San Salvador street. After being tortured and interrogated about the activities of the Democratic Convergence, he was driven away with another man who had also been detained and interrogated. When this vehicle stopped, he was forced to get out and a pistol was put to his head, but he managed to escape when the gun failed to go off. It is not known what happened to the other man. "
