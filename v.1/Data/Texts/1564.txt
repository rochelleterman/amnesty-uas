"Nigeria: incommunicado detention / health concern: Nosa Igiebor 
 NA 
 Nosa Igiebor, editor-in-chief of Tell magazine, was arrested on 23 December 1995 by officers of the State Security Services (SSS).  Since then he has been detained incommunicado and reportedly denied medication to treat hypertension and an ulcer.  No reason has been given for his arrest but it is likely that it is related to continuing criticsim of the Nigerian government by Tell magazine.
