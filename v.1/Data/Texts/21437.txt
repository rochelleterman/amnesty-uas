 Nizomkhon Juraev was released from a Russian detention facility on 29 March. He has not been seen since. He is a citizen of Tajikistan, and there are fears that he has been abducted by Tajikistani security services with the intent of forcibly returning him to Tajikistan. If returned to Tajikistan, he is at risk of torture, ill-treatment and an unfair trial. "
