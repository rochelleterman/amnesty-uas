 Japan: Fear of Imminent Execution | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The five men named in this action, who were convicted of murder between 2002 and 2007, are now believed to be at imminent risk of execution. Justice minister Mori Eisuke wants to accelerate the country's death penalty system, and is seeking to avoid public objections by singling out for execution those who, like these five, have recently abandoned their appeals or were convicted of crimes that have led to ‘public revulsion’."
