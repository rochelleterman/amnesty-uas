 NA 
 Fourteen women doctors in the Russian Republic of Ingushetia have repeatedly had their pictures and names distributed by the Russian authorities on posters, in the media and on the Internet.  The women were declared as ""wanted on suspicion of their involvement in terrorist activities."" The Nazran District Court of Ingushetia declared the actions of the MVD and the Main Department of Internal Affairs (GUVD) of Moscow to be illegal and demanded that all posters of the doctors should be removed and destroyed. The doctors are seeking compensation for the moral harm suffered."
