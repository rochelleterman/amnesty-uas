 On 20 March 1995 the Court of Cassation upheld the death sentences passed on Ra'ad 'Abd al-Amir 'Abbud al-Asadi and Wali 'Abd al-Hadi 'Abd al-Hassan al-Ghazali. These sentences would have to be ratified by the Amir of Kuwait before they can be carried out. The death sentences given to Salem Basser Subaih Rumi al-Shummari and Bandar 'Ujail Haber al-Shummari were reduced to life imprisonment. 'Adel Isma'il 'Issa al-Utaibi had his sentence reduced to 15 years. In the case of Badr Jiyad Thamer Mutlaq al-Shummari, the Court of Cassation overturned the conviction for attempted assassination but upheld the conviction for alcohol smuggling."
