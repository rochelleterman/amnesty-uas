 Humanitarian organizations report that they are still prevented from delivering aid to the disputed region of South Ossetia, leading to fears that civilians in the region are at risk of illness and starvation. It has also been reported that access to displaced people in parts of Georgia, including in the city of Gori, has also been hampered by the general lack of security. "
