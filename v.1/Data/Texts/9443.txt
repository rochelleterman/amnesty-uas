 USA [Tennessee]: Death penalty / Legal concern:  Philip Workman (m) 

 | Amnesty International 
 Philip Workman, aged 53,  is scheduled to be executed in Tennessee on 9 May despite compelling evidence that a key state witness lied at the trial and that the police officer Workman was convicted of killing may have been accidentally shot by a fellow officer. If so, Philip Workman would be innocent of capital murder and ineligible for the death penalty under US law. He has been on death row for 25 years. He has been scheduled for execution a number of times, and in 2001 was less than an hour from execution when a court issued a stay.
