 Dilshod Umarovich Kurbanov (m) and Mukhamedsolikh Matiakubovich Abutov (m) are in danger of being forcibly returned to Uzbekistan, where they would be at risk of incommunicado detention, torture and unfair trial leading to long prison terms or even the death penalty. They are wanted in connection with allegations that they are members of banned Islamic organizations and planned to overthrow the constitutional order of Uzbekistan. Both deny these allegations, and claim they are being persecuted because of their religious beliefs.
