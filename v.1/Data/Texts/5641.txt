 UA 23/93 - Ecuador: death threats, torture and harassment: Jose Ignacio Chauvin | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Jose Ignacio Chauvin, a 17-year-old schoolboy, was reportedly detained in Quito after leaving a poetry recital commemorating the ""disappeared"" Restrepo brothers. Six men in plain clothes reportedly seized and hooded him and forced him into a van where they kicked, beat and tortured him with electricity. Another man reportedly entered the van and ill-treated him further. Finally, a policeman reportedly entered the van and gave orders to stop beating him. Jose Ignacio Chauvin was then left on the street. These events were denounced to a local human rights organization, to the Tribunal of Constitutional Guarantees and to the Minister of the Interior. Jose Ignacio Chauvin has reported threats and harassment since the incident and has now left Quito. "
