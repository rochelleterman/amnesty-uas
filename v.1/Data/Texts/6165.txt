 AI is concerned for the safety of Rodrigo Batz Juarez, a teacher and human rights worker of indigenous Quiche / Mam origin who was forced to leave his home in the Department of Retalhuleu at the end of March 1995. Heavily armed men were seen twice near his home in March 1995. On one occasion they asked about his whereabouts. On the other, they fired shots in the air. It is believed that he may have been targeted on account of his work for the Centro Internacional de Investigaciones en Derechos Humanos."
