 | Amnesty International 
 On 13 November 2006, Sheikh Murad al-Khiznawi, a Syrian Kurdish activist, was arrested on Syria's border with Jordan as he attempted to flee the country. His father, a prominent Kurdish imam, was killed after ""disappearing"" and being tortured last year. Amnesty International fears that Murad al-Khiznawi is at risk of torture, ill-treatment, or even death.
