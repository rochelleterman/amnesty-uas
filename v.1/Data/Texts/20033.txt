 Dominican Republic: Fear for safety/death threats | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 People who appear to be linked to the authorities have abducted and assaulted a woman whose husband is of Haitian descent, and so faces official discrimination. The woman, Gysselle Baret Reyes, had appeared on TV on 2 July 2008 condemning the way her family had been treated. On 14 July she was forced into a car at gunpoint and assaulted over several hours. Her husband, Minoscal de Olis Oguiza, and his cousin, Emildo Bueno Oguis, have received death threats, and all are in grave danger."
