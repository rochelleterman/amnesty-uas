 At least 11 East Timorese have been detained in recent weeks, including Jose Antonio Neves, a student and leading member of the East Timorese pro-independence underground. He was detained by military intelligence on 19 May in Malang, but they have subsequently denied holding him. At least ten others were arrested in Dili, East Timor. Some of those detained are believed to have been released, but others, including a number of youths who staged a peaceful protest in Dili in front of foreign journalists in April, are still believed to be detained. There is grave concern for the safety of those still in custody, who are at risk of torture."
