 Up to 41 followers of the Islamic sect Al Arqam have been arrested in the past two weeks for distributing leaflets. On 5 August the National Fatwa Council, a conference of muftis, will announce its ruling on Al Arqam. There is concern that the group might be banned and its activities become illegal."
