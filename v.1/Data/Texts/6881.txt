 NA 
 Janne Toussaint has ""disappeared"" after being abducted from her apartment in Port-au-Prince on 19 June 1994 by eight armed men. She has been an active opponet of the de facto military government in Haiti. Her abduction took place after several interviews given by her husband, Levius Toussaint, to the radio programme ""Voice of America"" were broadcast. He is a political refugee in the United States. There are fears for the safety of Janne Toussaint and other members of her family who are still in Haiti."
