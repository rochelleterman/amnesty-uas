 Russian Federation: Further Information on Torture/Health Concern/Arbitrary detention:  Rasul Kudaev (m) | Amnesty International 
 Rasul Kudaev's, aged 27, state-appointed lawyer, Irina Komissarova, has been removed from his case after she filed a complaint that he had been tortured. She has probably been replaced, but the new lawyer has made no contact with Rasul Kudaev's family. His lawyer had been the family's sole means of contact with him, so they now have no information about whether he has been charged, or the state of his health. It is thought that he is still being denied adequate medical treatment.
