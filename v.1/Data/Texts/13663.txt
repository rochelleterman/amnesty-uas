 AI is gravely concerned by reports that a prisoner may be executed in Thailand on 8 October 1995, in what would be the first execution there since 1987. Newspaper reports say that a man, whose name is being withheld, would be executed in order to deter others from criminal activity. AI fears that the threat to execute the man may indicate a decision of the recently-elected Thai government to resume carrying out death sentences."
