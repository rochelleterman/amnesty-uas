 Nepal: Fear for safety: B.G.C.

 | Amnesty International 
 There are fears for the safety of a fifteen year old girl known for reasons of personal security as B.G.C., who was reportedly raped on 19 July 2007, by a soldier and a      civilian. While one of the alleged perpetrators, an army  soldier, has been handed over to police by the army       authority, the other alleged civilian perpetrator has not yet been arrested and there are therefore fears that as   B.G.C. attempts to seek justice she may be at risk of     intimidation or attack.
