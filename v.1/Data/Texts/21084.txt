 Several people were killed and around 200 others,         including 25 children, were arrested during clashes       between Indonesian security forces and civilians in Papua (Irian Jaya). Fifteen people remain in incommunicado      detention, and Amnesty International is concerned that    they are at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Two others  have been missing since they were detained by the army."
