 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Further information on fear for safety: non-Serbs in Bosnian Serb-controlled areas | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is continued concern for the safety of non-Serb civilians in the Bosnian Serb-controlled area around Banja Luka. The situation there is particularly tense following the recent arrival of tens of thousands of Serbian refugees displaced from the Krajina region and the area around Glamoc and Grahovo. Soldiers from these areas have reportedly committed a number of abuses in recent days in an attempt to take over the homes of Croats or Muslims. On 11 August a Croatian woman, Anica Mijatovic, was killed by unknown assailants in the village of Sargovac. Others in the village received threats and were told to leave. Last week a Croatian Serb soldier reportedly shot dead a Croatian man after he tried to assist some neighbours. On 4 August Serbian soldiers forcibly evicted a Croatian couple from their home with threats and violence. Other reports indicate that Bosnian Serb police have directly participated in expulsions around Banja Luka."
