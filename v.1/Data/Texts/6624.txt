 Guatemala: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is deeply concerned for the safety  of staff at the local offices of Guatemala's  human       rights ombudsman, Procuradoria de Derechos Humanos        (PDH), Human Rights Procurator's Office. Former civil     patrol members have threatened to burn down their offices if their demands for compensation for their patrol        service during Guatemala's long-term     civil conflict   are not fully met within 30 days.
