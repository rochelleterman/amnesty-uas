 | Amnesty International 
 Iraqi national Sajida Rishawi Atrous, aged around 37,who was sentenced to death for involvement in November 2005 suicide bombings, is now in imminent danger of execution. She was reportedly tortured severely to make her confess. An appeal to the Court of Cassation (which may only consider the trial procedures and not the substance of the case)   was rejected on 25 January. The death sentence will now be passed to the king for ratification. If he ratifies it, she could be executed at any time. The king has the power to stop her execution.
