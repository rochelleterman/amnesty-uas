 Luc網 Genaro Linares and Erika Gonz鷺ez Genaro, the mother and sister of S묚rates Tolento Gonz鷺ez Genaro, who died in police custody in January 2004, have reportedly been intimidated by unidentified men since the arrest of two former municipal police officers on 14 July 2006 in relation to S묚rates Genaro's death. Amnesty International believes that the acts of intimidation may be linked to the detentions and could increase as a reprisal for any legal action taken against the police officers.
