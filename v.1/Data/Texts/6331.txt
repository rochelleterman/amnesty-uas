 Amnesty International is concerned at recent renewed acts of intimidation against Helen Mack Chang. These and previous acts of intimidation against her and other members of AVANCSO, appear to be reprisals against the conviction of an army serjeant for the murder of Helen Mack Chang's sister, Myrna Mack. On 12 February 1993, army sergeant Noel de Jesus Beteta was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment for the murder of Myrna Mack, with an additional five years for a separate assault on a minor. On 29 April the Appeal Court ratified the sentence. "
