 Nepal: Torture / Ill-treatment / Medical concern  Deepak Thapa (m), aged 20 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the safety of Deepak Thapa, who was reportedly tortured by the police, following his arrest after a fight with a taxi-driver over a fare dispute. Deepak Thapa has been denied access to medical treatment, which he is unlikely to receive over the next few weeks, as the courts which could order the authorities to provide him with treatment, will be closed for a religious holiday.
