 There is concern for the safety of Batabiha Bushoki, secretary general of the Study and Action Group for a Well-defined Development (GEAD) and President of the Campaign for Peace, who was arrested on 21 November 1995.  It is alleged that two other men detained with him, but now released, were beaten in custody.  According to reports, the three men were arrested after responding to questions posed to them by members of the international press, while they were waiting to attend a meeting with the former President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, who was visiting the region."
