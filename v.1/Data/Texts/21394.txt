 United Kingdom: Health concern: Mahmoud Abu Rideh (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Lawyers for Mahmoud Abu Rideh, a Palestinian refugee who is subject to a ""control order"" imposed by the United Kingdom authorities, believe that there is a real risk he will commit suicide if the control order is not lifted or if he is not provided with travel documentation to leave the UK. He has previously attempted suicide on three occasions, most recently in May 2008."
