 AI remains concerned for the safety of Prince Sifiso Zulu and other members of the Zulu Royal House, in view of threats made against them and of the continuing political tensions in KwaZulu-Natal. On 11 December 1994, threats were made against Prince Sifiso Zulu and another member of the Royal House during an Inkatha Freedom Party rally. On 24 November, a former ANC Umkhonto we Sizwe guerrilla, Pat Hlongwane, who now has strong right-wing and security force connections, issued a statement implicitly calling for the death of Prince Sifiso Zulu. Members of the Royal House have reportedly also received threats by telephone."
