 Ethiopia: Prisoners of conscience / legal concern | Amnesty International 
 Kifle Mulat, chairperson of the Ethiopian Free Press Journalists Association (EFPJA), journalist on Ethio-Times; Goshu Moges, Taye Belachew, Birru Tsegaye, Anteneh Merid, Alemayehu Kifle, Lulu Kebede, Mukenil Shebo, Tamrat Gemeda: AI considers the nine above-named journalists, arrested in the past few weeks on account of publishing articles critical of the government, to be prisoners of conscience.They have been detained for investigation under the Press Law and, though some have been taken to court, none of them has yet been charged with any offence. AI is concerned that they may be detained without charge or trial for a long period or may be unfairly tried and sentenced to prison terms under a Press Law which restricts the freedom of the press.
