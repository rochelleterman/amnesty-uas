 UA 371/92 - Turkmenistan: death penalty: Aymurad Nuryyev, Mikhail Chirkunov, Saparbay Garakhanov | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The three men named above were sentenced to death for aggravated murder on or about 14 November 1992 in Ashgabat. They were tried by the Supreme Court, acting as a court of first instance and do not, therefore, have a right of appeal. They were convicted of murdering an inmate of a corrective labour colony on 31 May 1992; Mikhail Chirkunov and Saparbay Garakhanov were also inmates of the Tedzhen labour colony. The prosecution identified Ahmed Nuryyev as the leader of a criminal gang who had ordered the murder. This is the second time that Chirkunov and Garakhanov were tried for this murder: they were originally sentenced to imprisonment but following Nureyyev's arrest in May 1992 the case was referred for further investigation. AI is calling for the sentences to be commuted. "
