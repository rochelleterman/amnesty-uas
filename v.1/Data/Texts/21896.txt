 Two hundred families in Zerzara informal settlement in the city of Port Said, Egypt, are at risk of forced eviction to make way for a road. On 4 May 2010, with no prior notification, Port Saidâ€™s local authorities demolished 15 one-storey homes, leaving the families who lived there without alternative housing. There was a heavy police presence during the forced eviction and demolition. "
