 Trinidad & Tobago: Further information on death penalty: Anthony Briggs | Amnesty International 
 Anthony Briggs was hanged on the morning of 28 July 1999. Amnesty International is concerned that the execution     went ahead despite the fact that the Inter-American       Commission on Human Rights had recommended that his death sentence be commuted, and the Inter-American Court on     Human Rights had issued an order to the government to     preserve his life until it had  considered his case.
