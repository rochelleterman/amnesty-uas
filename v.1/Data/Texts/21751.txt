 Bahrain: 200 people detained after party in Bahrain | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 At least 200 people are detained at an unknown location in Bahrain after being present at what some local media have described as a “gay party”. The media claim that many of the attendants at the party are “gay” and have committed acts that constitute “immoral behaviour”, although no official charges have been filed against the detainees."
