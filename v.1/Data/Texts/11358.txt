 Jagwinder Singh, a 24-year-old lawyer, was reportedly arrested on 25 September 1992. He has not been seen since. His family have signed affidavits stating that they witnessed police taking him away from his house in Mahalla Laxmi Nagar, Kapurthala. Lawyers' associations in Punjab have protested against the arrest and the subsequent failure to disclose his whereabouts. The Chief Minister, Chief Secretary and the Finance Minister of Punjab have reportedly given assurances to lawyers that his whereabouts will soon be disclosed but this has not yet happened. "
