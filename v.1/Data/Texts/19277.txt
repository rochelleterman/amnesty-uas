 Tunisia: Further information on prisoner of conscience / health concern: Mohamed Mouadda | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned about the recent deterioration of the health of Mohamed Moudda, who suffers from duodenal ulcer and high blood pressure. He began a hunger strike on 13 July 1997 to protest at his continued house arrest. AI considers him a prisoner of conscience and is calling for the immediate and unconditional lifting of the house arrest order.
