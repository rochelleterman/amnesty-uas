 Iraq: Further information: Iraqi detainees report torture | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A group of detainees held in Iraq, who were accused in a television programme of terrorism-related offences, have reported that they have been tortured. They say that they were coerced into making “confessions” that appeared on the programme. At least four of them continue to be denied access to a lawyer or to treatment for injuries apparently sustained during torture. "
