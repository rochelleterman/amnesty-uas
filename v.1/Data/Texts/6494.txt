 Guatemala: Further information on extrajudicial execution: Mons. Juan Gerardi Condera | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International remains deeply concerned at the     shortcomings and bias of the official investigation into  the Bishop Juan Jos? Gerardi's murder and at the failure  to protect possible witnesses and those involved in the   investigation. The prosecutor investigating the case      resigned and fled to the United States on 7 October 1999  to seek political asylum after receiving repeated death   threats since being appointed to handle the case.
