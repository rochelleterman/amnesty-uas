 USA (New York): Further information on death penalty: possible reinstatement of the death penalty | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 7 March 1995, the Governor of New York, George E Pataki, signed a death penalty bill into law. The law will be effective from 1 September 1995. AI regrets this development. AI opposes the death penalty as a violation of the right to life and the right not be be subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment as proclaimed in Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
