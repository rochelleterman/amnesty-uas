 The army arrested three people in northern Mexico, for reasons unclear, on 29 December 2009.  Their fate and whereabouts are unknown and they may have been subjected to enforced disappearance. Human rights defenders working on their behalf may also be at risk, as another activist working on abuses by the military was murdered on 3 January. "
