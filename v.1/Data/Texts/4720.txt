 There is serious concern for the safety of Gabriel Adelfo Riano Prieto and other student activists at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia Seccional Bogota. It is feared that their activities in denouncing the recent killing of a fellow students (Humberto Pena Taylor) and calling for it to be investigated may put their own lives at risk."
