 The three men named above have not been seen since 11 February 1993, when witnesses observed their detention close to the town of Villavicencio, Meta department, by armed men believed to members of the security forces. The three, all campesinos (peasant farmers) were travelling on a public service vehicle which was stopped twice by the security forces. On the second occasion, the three were taken away in a vehicle, believed to belong to the security forces' Anti-extortion and Kidnap Unit. It is believed one of the men may have been taken in the mistaken belief that he was Fidel Ortiz, accused by the army of collaborating with the guerrillas. "
