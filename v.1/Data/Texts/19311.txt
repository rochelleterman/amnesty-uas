 Yemen: Death penalty / legal concern: Yahya Naji Muhammad al-Asadi | Amnesty International 
 Ten years after being sentenced to death in a trial which may have violated international standards, Yahya Naji Muhammad al-Asadi, aged 45, is feared to be at imminent risk of execution. He was sentenced to death for murder in 1986 and in about 1991 his file was closed after witnesses reportedly retracted their statements. On 9 January 1995, a Criminal Court upheld the death sentence. The case has been pending since then.
