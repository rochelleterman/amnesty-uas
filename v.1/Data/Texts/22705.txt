 Syria: Haytham al-Maleh's health failing: Further information | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Prisoner of conscience Haytham al-Maleh is very ill, and he has not taken any of the medication he needs since 11 February 2010. Since 11 February, the authorities have not allowed detainees in 'Adra prison to obtain medication from anywhere but the prison pharmacy. Haytham al-Maleh will only take medication provided by his family, because he believes the prison pharmacy's medicine is of poor quality."
