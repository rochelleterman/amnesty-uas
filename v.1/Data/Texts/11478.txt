 Nelson Rumbiak, aged 20, Ferdinando Pakage and 14 other men have been convicted of alleged involvement in violence in Papua province in March, following an unfair trial. One of the men, Nelson Rumbiak, was reportedly beaten by police officers after revealing in court that he had been intimidated and ill-treated in police custody. Amnesty International is concerned that all 16 men, as well as seven others (including Aris Mandowen) whose trial is still in progress, are at risk of torture or ill-treatment.
