 There is concern for the safety of Enoch Nzuza, a trade union organizer and African National Congress (ANC) member, and for members of his family, following recent attacks on them by armed men acting with the acquiescence of the local police. Enoch Nzuza is Northern Natal North regional organizer for the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA), and has survived at lease two previous assassination attempts. On 12 February 1994 unidentified men forced his car off the road and fired at him. On 20 February two men entered his home and shot his brother, Mandla Nzuza, in the neck and thigh. He survived the attack, but the police showed little interest in investigating the incident. There are fears that those responsible are linked to the local Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)-aligned chief, Boy Mzimela."
