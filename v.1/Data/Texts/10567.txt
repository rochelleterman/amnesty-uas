 On 2 December 1995 armed soldiers of the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Organization (DKBO) entered Sho Clo Camp on the Thai border, where thousands of Karen displaced people live. A group of Karen civilians were attending a funeral service when the soldiers opened fire, killing Saw Wah, a Christian schoolteacher. On 6 October Ka Ka Per, the leader of Sho Clo Camp's Section 1, and another man, Ka Lar, were shot dead by DKBO troops."
