 24 members of the Partido del Progreso de Guinea Ecuatorial (PPGE) were reportedly arrested in Malabo between 1 and 3 September 1992. Severo Moto Nsa, the leader of the party, was released after being questioned for several hours. AI is concerned that those still detained, including a minor and two women, may be prisoners of conscience, imprisoned on account of their membership of a non-violent political party. AI is also concerned by reports that they were beaten at the time of arrest and tortured or ill treated in custody. The people named above are reported to be held in Black Beach Prison, Malabo; the other 16 are reportedly detained at the Direccion Nacional de Seguridad. Some are said to have sustained serious injuries but not to have received medical treatment. "
