 UA 104/94 - Cuba: fear for safety: Francisco Chaviano Gonzalez | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Francisco Chaviano Gonzalez, President of the unofficial National Council for Civil Rights in Cuba, after he was attacked and threatened by four armed men who broke into his home in Jaimanitas, Havana on 7 March 1994. There were several witnesses to the attack, but the assailants said they could act with impunity because they had ""bought"" the cooperation of the police. They reportedly implied that their actions were aimed at persuading government critics to leave the country. Francisco Chaviano reported the incident to police, but this is said only to have resulted in the intimidation of the witnesses."
