 New names: Win Win Htay, Ko Htay Win, Ko Myint Htay, Ko Min Min, Ko Aye Htun, Ko May Wai, Ko Myo Khin, Ko Kyaw Zaw, Ko Thein Lin, U Po Aye: The total number of arrests of members of the National League for Democracy has risen to some 220 people over the last four days. AI is particularly concerned about the arrest of nine NLD youth members, as young detainees are at a higher risk of ill-treatment in custody. AI considers all of them to be prisoners of conscience.
