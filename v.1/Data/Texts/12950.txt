 Pakistan: Further information on prisoner of conscience / fear of torture: Humayun Far, journalist | Amnesty International 
 The whereabouts of journalist Humayn Far, arrested on 28 June 1997 in Islamabad, remain unknown. On 8 July a hearing of the habeas corpus petition was heard at the Lahore High Court, although the prisoner was not brought before the court as directed by the judge. A state representative, however, reportedly said that Humayun Far was in the detention of military intelligence. The court directed that the state should clarify on 14 July on what legal grounds he is being detained and insisted that he should be seen by the judge.
