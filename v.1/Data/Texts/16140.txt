 Turkmenistan: Fear for safety: anti-government demonstrators | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned for the safety of those involved in an unprecedented anti-government demonstration reported to have taken  place in Ashgabat on 12 July 1995. Fears that the authorities may clamp down on anyone they identify as involved in the demonstration have been heightened by unconfirmed reports of the immediate detention of leaders of the demonstration. The demonstration, which was peaceful, appears to have taken the Turkmenistan authorities by suprise. AI is calling on the authorities to refrain from detaining any organizers or participants in the 12 July demonstration and to release immediately anyone who might already have been detained."
