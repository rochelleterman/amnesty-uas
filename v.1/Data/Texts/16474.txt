 Federal Republic of Yugoslavia: Possible extrajudicial execution/repression of media: Slavko Curuvija | Amnesty International 
 Slavko  uruvija, the editor of newspapers critical of the Yugoslav government, was murdered on 11 April 1999        outside his home in Belgrade.  It has been alleged that   his murder was instigated by the authorities. Serbian     state television and the pro-government press had         recently accused him of welcoming NATO air strikes, which friends say he opposed. His death heightens concern for   other independent journalists and members of Serbia's     opposition.
