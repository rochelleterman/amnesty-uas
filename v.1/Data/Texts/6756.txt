 Amnesty International has learned that no attempt was ever made to arrest Dr Fernand Hachette, as reported in the original UA. He has now left the country and his life is therefore not in danger. However, information has been received that other members of the PAEPD have been subjected to threats and harassment by armed men in civilian clothes, believed to be linked to the security forces."
