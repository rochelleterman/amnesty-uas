 Mexico: Fear for safety: Rubén Valencia Núñez | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Rubén Valencia Núñez was harassed and attacked on 10 January 2009. He is an activist with Oaxacan Voices Building Autonomy and Liberty (VOCAL). Rubén Valencia had publicly spoken out against state and municipal police following a raid they carried out on a house where a group of young activists organise cultural and political activities. Amnesty International is concerned that because Rubén Valencia is a prominent member of VOCAL, he is at continued risk of attacks and intimidation."
