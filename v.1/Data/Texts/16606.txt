"Egypt: Death penalty: Wa'il Mohammad Ahmad Waziry 
 NA 
 There is concern that the death sentence handed down by the Alexandria criminal court on 19-year-old labourer Wa'il Mohammad Ahmad Waziry, was upheld on 8 January 1997 by the Court of Cassation. There is further concern that he may have committed the murder of which he was found guilty, before he reached the age of 18. If his death sentence is confirmed he could be executed within the next few weeks.
