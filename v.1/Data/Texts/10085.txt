 USA: Further information: Fear of unfair trials / Death penalty, Zacarias Moussaoui and others | Amnesty International 
 The US authorities will try French national Zacarias Moussaoui in a normal federal criminal court, rather than before one of the military tribunals that could be set up by the Military Order signed by President George W. Bush on 13 November. Amnesty International welcomes the fact that Zacarias Moussaoui will not be tried by a special military commission and continues to call for the Military Order to be revoked before anyone faces such tribunals.
