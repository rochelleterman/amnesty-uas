 UA 391/93 - Congo: fear of extrajudicial execution: at least 15 people killed and dozens injured | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is grave concern at reports that at least 15 people were killed and 100 seriously injured by government troops, after fighting broke out between security forces and armed opposition supporters in Brazzaville on 3 November. There are fears that some of those killed may have been extrajudicially executed. The fighting broke out when government forces moved into the Bacongo suburb of Brazzaville following the kidnap and subsequent release of two civil servants by armed opposition supporters. The security forces used automatic and heavy weapons, including rockets, in an apparently indiscriminate use of lethal force, in which many houses were destroyed or damaged. Five members of the security forces were also killed by opposition gunmen. "
