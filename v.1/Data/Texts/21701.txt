 The authorities in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, are preparing to carry out the latest in a series of forced evictions of Roma communities living in informal settlements. At least 70 homes in an area known as Vidikovac will be demolished. The families who live there could be left homeless as a result of the evictions."
