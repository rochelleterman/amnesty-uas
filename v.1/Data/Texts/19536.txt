 Since 2 May, 11 members of a human rights organization in Mauritania have been detained at an unknown location by the Mauritanian authorities after protesting against the writings of Islamic scholars. Amnesty International believes that they are prisoners of conscience, detained for peacefully expressing their views. They may be at risk of ill-treatment."
