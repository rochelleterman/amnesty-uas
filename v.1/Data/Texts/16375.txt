 Croatia: Fear for safety / fear of refoulement: Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim | Amnesty International

 AI is seriously concerned for the safety of Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, an Egyptian political refugee who has not been seen since he was arrested in Zagreb shortly after arriving from Amsterdam. The Egyptian government has reportedly asked the Croatian authorities to send him to Egypt where he faces execution, having been sentenced to death in absentia in 1992. The Croatian authorities have reportedly stated that he left the country on 18 September after the Magistrates' Court had fined him and ordered him to leave the country."
