 Brazil: death threats / fear for safety: Mauricio Assayag, Jose Muinos Pineiro, Maria Lucia Capiberibe (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Public prosecutors (promotores) Mauricio Assayag and Jose Muinos Pineiro and Judge Maria Lucia Capiberibe have reportedly been receiving increasingly frequent death threats. The threats are thought to be related to their role in legal proceedings against a number of military and civil police officials charged with the ""Vigario Geral"" massacre in which 21 people were killed on 31 August 1993. AI is calling on the authorities to take immediate steps to guarantee the physical safety of the people named in this action."
