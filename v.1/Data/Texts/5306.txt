 AI remains concerned about the safety of human rights lawyer Luis Guillermo Perez and his family, who have been subjected to further intimidation. The escort with which he and his family had been provided after an expression of international concern about former acts of intimidation did not arrive on 8 November 1994. That morning, Luis Guillermo Perez and his wife were followed to his office by a motorcycle. Another motorcycle followed Katia Karina Nino Vanegas to her son's school. She was also followed later in the day by individuals on motorcycles. AI is calling for concrete measures to be taken to protect their lives."
