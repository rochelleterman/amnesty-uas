 NA 
 James Briddle, white, is scheduled to be executed in Texas on 12 December 1995. He was sentenced to death in 1982 for murder. His present attorney is appealing on the grounds that he received ineffective legal representation at his original trial, including the fact that the jury were not made aware of Briddle's troubled childhood."
