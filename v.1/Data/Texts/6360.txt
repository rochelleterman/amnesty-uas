 Guatemala: Further information on  Death threats/fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Several of those threatened have given key forensic testimony in proceedings against former government officials for past human rights violations. Five of the 11 people who received death threats on 21 February received anonymous telephone death threats against themselves and their families on 7 March. Miguel Morales was held up at gunpoint on 6 March, by men who demanded his mobile telephone. This may be how the anonymous caller obtained the other scientists' numbers. Their phone lines appear to have been tapped.
