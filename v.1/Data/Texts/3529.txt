 Eritrea: Fear of torture / fear of ill-treatment / Detention without charge | Amnesty International 
 On 24 January 2004 Eritrean police arrested 38 members of the Jehovah's Witnesses religion who were holding a religious service in a private home in the capital, Asmara. Ten were released without charge in the next few days but 28 remain in custody, including children, and a 90-year-old man. Amnesty International considers them prisoners of conscience, detained solely because of their religious beliefs.
