 Syria: Torture and ill-treatment/ possible unfair trial	 | Amnesty International 
 Fifteen Syrian Kurds have reportedly been tortured and ill-treated by guards in Adra prison near the capital Damascus and are at risk of further torture and ill-treatment. They are scheduled to be tried in mid-February 2005 for their alleged involvement in protests and riots which broke out following clashes at a football match in Qamishli, north-eastern Syria, on 12 March 2004. They are at risk of an unfair trial, and may be sentenced to death.
