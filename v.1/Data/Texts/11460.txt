 Indonesia: Further information on fear of imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International fears that Fabianus Tibo, Dominggus da Silva and Marinus Riwu are at risk of imminent execution at any time from 20 August 2006 onwards. They had been scheduled to be executed on 12 August, but received a last-minute stay of execution. The exact date of the rescheduled executions is currently unknown. If the three men are executed, they will mark the first executions by Indonesia in 2006.
