 On 7 and 8 June 1994 plenary sessions of the Colombian Congressional House of Deputies and Senate approved a draft law against ""disappearances"". In order for it to become effective it must be promulgated by President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo by 20 July 1994. There are fears he either may fail to do so, or may introduce modifications which will seriously weaken its effectiveness."
