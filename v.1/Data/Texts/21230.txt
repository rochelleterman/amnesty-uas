 Sri Lanka: Arbitrary detention/ medical concern: Jayaprakash Sittampalam Tissainaygam | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Journalist Jayaprakash Sittampalam (J. S.) Tissainaygam has been held in the Terrorist Investigation Division detention centre in Colombo since 7 March 2008. The authorities have claimed that he is held on suspicion of involvement with the armed group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, although he has not been charged with any offence. Amnesty International believes that his detention is arbitrary. He is at risk of going blind if he does not receive specialist treatment for a serious eye condition."
