 Yemen: Fear of torture and ill-treatment/Incommunicado detention	 | Amnesty International 
 Zaid Ali Amer (m), Hassan Ali Ajlan al-Nu'mi (m), Majed al-Huthi (m), teacher, Adel Shalli (m) and Muhammad Ali Luqman (m) have been detained during mass arrests following clashes between the security forces and followers of cleric Hussain Badr al-Din al-Huthi, which began on 21 June. Up to several hundred people have reportedly been detained, and most are held incommunicado, which puts them at grave risk of torture and ill-treatment. They and many other detainees may be prisoners of conscience, held solely for expressing their conscientiously held beliefs.
