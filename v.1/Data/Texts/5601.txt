 Cuba: Prisoners of conscience / health concern | Amnesty International 
 Opposition activists Marcel Valenzuela Salt and Marlon    Cabrera were arrested on 14 September 1999.  Amnesty      International is   concerned that they have been detained solely for         exercising their right to freedom of   expression, and      considers them prisoners of          conscience. They have begun a hunger strike, which they   reportedly say they will        continue until they are   released.
