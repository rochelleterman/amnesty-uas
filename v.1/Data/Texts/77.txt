 Angola: Fear of refoulement / fear for safety: Rwandese refugees on Zaire/Angola border | Amnesty International 
 There are fears that Rwandese refugees, including women and children, are being prevented from crossing into and seeking asylum in Angola. There is further concern that others who have entered Angola may not have had an adequate opportunity to seek asylum, and that some may have been returned to Zaire, where they are at risk of serious human rights abuses.
