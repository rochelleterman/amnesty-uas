 Uzbekistan: Follow up to Death Penalty / possible imminent execution

 | Amnesty International 
 Arsen Arutyunyan's death sentence was commuted to 15      years' imprisonment by the Supreme Court on 31 March.     However, Amnesty International is waiting to hear whether the Supreme Court has reviewed Danis Sirazhev's death     sentence, and is concerned that he may still be facing    execution.
