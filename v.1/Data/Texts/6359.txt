 Guatemala: Fear for safety: Members of FAMDEGUA | Amnesty International 
 There is grave concern for the safety of members of the   Asociacion de Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos de    Guatemala (FAMDEGUA), Association of Relatives of the     Detained-Disappeared of Guatemala, and other relatives of ""disappeared"" Guatemalans, who have been harassed and     have received death threats during the last two months.   These threats follow the publication of a log-book on 20  May 1999, which allegedly records the activities of a     Guatemalan military death squad.
