 USA: Fear of forcible return: Abdul Ra'ouf Omar Mohammed Abu al Qassim (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Abdul Ra'ouf al Qassim, a Libyan national in US military custody in Guantænamo Bay, Cuba, is feared to be at imminent risk of transfer to the custody of the Libyan government. Amnesty International (AI) is concerned that he would be held in prolonged incommunicado detention without charge in Libya, putting him at serious risk of torture and other ill-treatment. The organization is also concerned that he could eventually face an unfair trial and the possibility of the death penalty.
