 UA 329/93 - Haiti: fear for physical safety: Fathers Antoine Adrien and William Smarth | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There are fears for the safety of Fathers Antoine Adrien and William Smarth, who are expected to officiate at the funeral of Antoine Izmery on 18 September. A prominent supporter of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, he was murdered by gunmen, described by some sources as plainclothes policemen, after being dragged from a church on 11 September. Both priests have been the subjects of death threats in the past, and it is feared that Antoine Izmery's funeral may provide the occasion for an attack on them and others who attend it. "
