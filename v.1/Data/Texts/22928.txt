 Tunisia: Two years behind Tunisian bars for speaking out | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 1 March 2007 marks the second anniversary of the imprisonment of lawyer and human rights defender Mohammed Abbou, prompting Amnesty International once again to call for his immediate and unconditional release. The organization considers him a prisoner of conscience, who continues to be detained solely for the peaceful expression of his opinion after he published articles denouncing torture in Tunisia and criticizing the Tunisian authorities.
