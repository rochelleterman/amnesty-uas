 Tajikistan: ""Disappearance"" | Amnesty International 
 Rizoali Ojiyev, Gadoali Ojiyev: These two brothers have apparently ""disappeared"" after being detained by people believed to be law enforcement officials on 28 February and 1 March 1997. They are members of the Badakhshani ethnic group and it is believed they may be suspected by the government of involvement with armed opposition groups. Those who know the brothers deny the existence of any such involvement. They have been allegedly under surveillance in Dushanbe and Khujand where they run an import business.
