 Guatemala: Torture/ill-treatment / fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Eswin Rocael Ruiz Zacarias, Edwin Tulio Enriquez Garcia, Belarnino Gonzalez de Leon: There is concern at the reported abduction, ill-treatment and torture of the above trade unionists, allegedly by members of the security forces or persons operating on their behalf. On 13 March, four heavily-armed plain-clothed men abducted the three men from the assembly plant where they work in the Canton Najarito, Villa Nueva, and took them to the Villa Nueva police station. There they were allegedly interrogated by their abductors about a robbery at the plant. During this time they were reportedly beaten and tortured. Afterwards they were released and warned not to tell anyone about what had happened. Amnesty International remains concerned for their safety.
