 Guatemala: Intimidation/fear for safety, Staff of         AVANCSO, social science research  institute | Amnesty International 
 Armed men broke into the offices of the Asociaci—n para el Avance de las Ciencias Sociales (AVANCSO), Investigation Centre for the Advancement of Social Sciences, on 20 March. The break-in appears to have been a clear attempt to intimidate AVANSCO staff, who have investigated areas of military activity, including human rights violations, that the army would prefer to keep secret. Amnesty International is concerned for their safety, and is concerned that this kind of intimidation will prevent them from carrying out their vital investigative work.
