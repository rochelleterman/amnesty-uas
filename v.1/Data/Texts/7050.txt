 Honduras: Further information on threats/fear for safety: Julio César Pineda Alvarado | Amnesty International 
 Julio C_sar Pineda Alvarado and his family have received  three further threatening anonymous telephone calls since returning to their home.  Amnesty International is        concerned for his and his family's safety as the          authorities have failed to effectively investigate the    original crime leaving the perpetrators free to carry out further threats and attacks.
