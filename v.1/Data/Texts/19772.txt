 NA 
 On 14 May 2008, German immigration authorities forcibly returned Eritrean nationals Yonas Haile Mehari and Petros Aforki Mulugeta to Eritrea. Neither man has been seen since they arrived in the capital, Asmara. Amnesty International believes they were detained at Asmara airport upon arrival, and are being held incommunicado. They are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment."
