 Samuel Nyawo, an ANC member and shop steward of the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA) was killed by armed men on 26 August 1992. Enoch Nzuza, NUMSA regional organizer and ANC member narrowly escaped death the same day when gunmen shot at him on his way to work. Shortly before Samuel Nyawo's killing, the home of Bheki Ntuli, Northern Natal regional chairman of COSATU and NUMSA shop steward, was attacked by armed men. On the same evening, the six men named above, all ANC members, were killed. These incidents occurred in a month during which 25 other people were killed in or near Esikhawini township. AI is disturbed by allegations suggesting that they were carried out by a hit-squad with links to the KwaZulu police and is calling for a full investigation. "
