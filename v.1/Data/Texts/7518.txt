 Mexico: Fear for safety / ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Gloria Roque Bautista (f), Rocio Mesino Mesino (f), Eusebio Vazquez: There is concern for the safety of the above peasant activists and human rights defenders following a raid on the offices of the Organizacion Campesina de la Sierra del Sur (OCSS), by four unidentified armed men. They reportedly ill-treated Gloria Roque Bautista, while asking her for the home addresses of Rocio Mesino Mesino and Eusebio Vazquez, leaders of the OCSS. These two, among other members of the OCSS, have been the target of several recent death threats, apparently linked to preparations for the second anniversary of the massacre of Aguas Blancas.
