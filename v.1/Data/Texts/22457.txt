 On 22 November, Israeli authorities demolished approximately 30 structures in the Bedouin village of al-‘Araqib in the Negev in southern Israel for the seventh time since July. The residents – citizens of Israel with a long-established claim to the area – are trying to rebuild their homes yet again but face increasing hardship as winter approaches."
