 Sudan: Human Rights Defender/Fear for Safety | Amnesty International 
 Adib Abdel Rahman Yusuf, a human rights defender from Darfur, was arrested in the capital, Khartoum, on 10 September by National Security and Intelligence Agency officers. He is now held incommunicado at the political section of the National Security and Intelligence Agency offices in Khartoum. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful pursuit of his lawful occupation. In the experience of Amnesty International, detainees held incommunicado are more likely to be tortured.
