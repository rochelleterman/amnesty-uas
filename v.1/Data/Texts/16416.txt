 Salih Salihu, an ethnic Albanian political prisoner, is reportedly seriously ill in prison, apparently as a result of ill-treatment. Reports of his ill-health go back to October 1993 following his arrest in July 1993. He was convicted by the district court of Pristina on charges of conspiring to obtain by force the secession of Kosovo province. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. At the opening of his trial in December 1993, he was reportedly too ill to walk unaided. Following his trial he was transferred to Belgrade Central Prison, where his health is said to have deteriorated further as a result of ill-treatment. He is reported to have complained of acute pains in his hip and back."
