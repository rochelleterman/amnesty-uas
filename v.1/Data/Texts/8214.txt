"Peru: Fear for Safety. 
 Peru: Fear for Safety. | Amnesty International 
 The offices of two Peruvian human rights organisations:   Paz y Esperanza and Comisi—n de Derechos Humanos have     been burgled. The break-ins are believed to be the   work of   people linked to the recently disestablished         Servicio de  Inteligencia   Nacional (SIN), and intended  to       intimidate.  The umbrella organization:          Coordinadora Nacional de Derechos Humanos,  campaigning   for the creation of a Truth and Justice Commission to     investigate human rights violations, is seriously         concerned for the     safety of all of its members, and   for witnesses of human   rights violations.
