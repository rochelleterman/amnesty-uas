 Thacien Sibomana (m) and Poppon Mudugu (m) were arrested on 21 May as they attempted to hold a monthly meeting at a local centre in the town of Gitega. They have been charged with ""threatening state security"" and are being held in Gitega Prison. Amnesty international considers the men to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of assembly, association and expression.
