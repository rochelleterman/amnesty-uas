 Turkey: medical action: Fahrettin Inal | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern at reports that police forcibly removed and detained Fahrettin Inal from hospital on 16 July 1994 despite the fact that he had sustained serious injuries, including multiple fractures, the day before. He is reported to have jumped from a fifth floor while being followed by police. He had previously been detained in 1992 and severely tortured. There are fears he may be undergoing further torture and ill-treatment under interrogation in incommunicado detention."
