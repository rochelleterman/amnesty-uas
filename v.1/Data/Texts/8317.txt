 Josias Ramirez Angulo, a leading member of the Lamas Municipal Workers Union, was killed on the night of 7-8 September 1992 as he returned to his home in Lamas, capital of San Martin department. According to the Social Action Office of the Moyobamba Prefecture, investigations into the killing by the office of the Lamas provincial prosecutor concluded that a corporal attached to the Special Unit N. 115 of the Tarapoto Command was the perpetrator. The provincial prosecutor has reportedly written four times to the head of the Huallaga Front Political-Military Command to request that the corporal report to the prosecutor's office or to the police. So far, the head of the command has apparently refused to order the corporal to comply with the request. "
