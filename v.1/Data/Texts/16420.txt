 Serbia (Kosovo): Further information on K.Z. (m) (full name known to Amnesty International) | Amnesty International 
 K.Z. has fled Kosovo, in fear for his life, and is now applying for refugee status in a third country.  As the   head of a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)   rights organization in Kosovo, he had received a death    threat linked to his work and sexual identity. The police gave him no protection, and he feared his life was in     danger and so fled the country. He is no longer in        danger, but Amnesty International will be monitoring his  situation closely.
