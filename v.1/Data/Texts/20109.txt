 NA 
 On 19 October 2008 a relative of Norma Cruz was stopped by an unknown man driving a pick-up truck and was told by the man to “get in or you’re going to die”. The relative got in the back where there were two masked men, one holding a gun. They drove the relative around repeating “you’re going to die”. The relative was released after 20 minutes one block away from Norma Cruz’s home. Norma Cruz is an active women’s human rights defender."
