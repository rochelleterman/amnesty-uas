 Zubair Zubairaev was again severely beaten on 10 and 12 April 2009, according to a report from his lawyer. When Zubair Zubairaevâ€™s lawyer visited him in the prison hospital in Volgograd on 23 April, he noticed signs of beatings on his client's body. He asked the prison hospital official to call for a doctor so that the injuries could be documented; however, the official reportedly refused to do so. "
