 Diego Arcos Meneses was freed from a state prison on 4 December 2007 as the prosecution dropped all charges against him on grounds of lack of evidence. However, there are still outstanding arrest warrants against 20 other people, who may face unfair legal proceedings.  There have been no advances in the search for Pedro N£_ez Pârez, Mariano Pârez GuzmÊn, Miguel Moreno Montejo and Juan Pe_ate Montejo, who have all been missing since November 2006.
