 Ethiopia: Fear of torture/ Detention without charge/ Possible prisoners of conscience. | Amnesty International 
 Hundreds of people have been detained in Awassa, capital  of Ethiopia's  Southern Region, in a second wave of       arrests that began in late July in connection with a      peaceful demonstration on 24 May. They are reportedly     being held incommunicado without charge or trial, and may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Many of them may  be prisoners of conscience, detained without charge for   their non-violent opinions.
