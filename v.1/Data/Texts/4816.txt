 AI continues to be concerned for the safety of Gabriel Riano Prieto after receiving reports that members of his family and their neighbours have been intimidated in order to reveal Gabriel Riano's whereabouts. AI is calling for these allegations of harassment to be investigated and for all possible measures to be taken to protect Gabriel Riano and other members of the Comite de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia por la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos. AI is also calling  for a full and impartial investigation into the killing of Humberto Pena Taylor on 13 June 1995."
