 Indonesia: prisoners of conscience / medical concern: Muchtar Pakpahan, Amosi Telaumbanua | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 16 January 1995, the High Court in Medan, North Sumatra, increased the sentences of trade union leaders Muchtar Pakpahan and Amosi Telaumbanua from three to four years in the first case and from 15 months to three years in the second. Both are leaders of the SBSI trade union. AI believes them to be prisoners of conscience who should be released immediately. AI is also concerned that Muchtar Pakpahan may not be receiving adequate medical attention for a kidney complaint."
