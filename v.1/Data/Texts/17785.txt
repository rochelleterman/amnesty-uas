 Israel: Further information on Legal concern/incommunicado detention: Detainees suspected of ""security"" offences | Amnesty International 
 On 27 June the Israeli Knesset (parliament) passed an amended version of the new Law 5765 - 2006, ""Criminal Procedure (Enforcement Powers - Detention) (Detainees Suspected of Security Offences) (Temporary Provision)"". According to this amended version of the law detainees suspected of ""security"" offences may be held by security forces for 96 hours before being brought before a judge, which is double the period allowed under law previously in force.
