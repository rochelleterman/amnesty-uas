 According to a letter to German parliamentarians from the Chinese Ambassador in Germany, information that Lodroe Gyatso may have been facing trial and imminent execution was ""unfounded and wrong"". However, Lodroe Gyatso has been sentenced to an additional six years; in prison, plus three years' deprivation of political rights for ""instigating unrest to overthrow the government and splitting the mother country"". He is reportedly imprisoned in Tibet and is in good health."
