 Sergeant Muhammad Rif'at, aged 23, Major Ibrahim Farid Shukairi: Sergeant Rif'at has not been heard of since he was arrested on 1 July 1996. Major Farid was arrested on 7 July and has been held in incommunicado detention. Reportedly he has already suffered torture. Amnesty International is also concerned that the two men have been held apparently without charge or trial.
