 Between 19 and 21 September 1995, members of the Mobile Rural Patrol Unit and combined police security forces carried out a wave of arrests of peasant and community leaders in the Chapare area of Cochabamba department.  AI's concern for the safety of the detainees has been heightened by allegations that at least some of them have been ill-treated during interrogation.  One of the detainees, David Herrera, has reportedly remained in incommunicado detention since his arrest."
