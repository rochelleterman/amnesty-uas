 The three Egyptian aid workers named above, working on an education program run by the Roman Catholic Church of Khartoum, were arrested on 18 April 1994. They are reportedly accused of irregularities in their legal and tax status but other reports suggest that their arrest represents an attempt to harass Christian church staff involved in relief and development work with people living in squatter camps outside Khartoum. Their present whereabouts are unknown and there are fears that they may be at risk of torture. On 19 April, Kamal Tadros, an Egyptian Catholic deacon who manages the education project, was arrested. He was released a week later."
