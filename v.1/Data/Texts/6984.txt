 Jean-Marc Philogene was reportedly killed on 6 December 1992 in circumstances suggesting extrajudicial execution. He was one of the students reportedly detained by the armed forces on 1 December during protests at the State University of Haiti. According to reports, he was shot five times after his original detention but survived and was treated in the Canape Vert hospital. On 6 December a man reportedly came to the hospital inquiring about him; later, a group of five gunmen shot him dead in front of his family. "
