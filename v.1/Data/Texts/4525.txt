 NA 
 Jaime Enrique Quintero Cano has not been seen since 4 March 1995 when he was arrested and taken to a military prison cell by members of the armed forces. On 1 March he reported to the army's IV Brigade headquarters in Medellin for compulsory military service. He was reportedly then sent to the Voltigeros Battallion in Uraba region. The authorities there have claimed he was sent back by bus to Medellin on 4 March after attacking the commanding officer. However, soldiers attached to the Voltigeros Battallion have informed Jaime Enrique Quintero's family that he was arrested and badly beaten. There is serious concern for his safety."
