 Turkmenistan: Fear of imminent execution / possible prisoner of conscience: Ashirgeldy Sadyyev | Amnesty International 
 Ashirgeldy Sadyyev, a taxi driver, was sentenced to death on 21 May 1997 by Ashgabat City Court after being convicted of drug trafficking. There is concern at allegations that the quantity of opium found in his possession prior to his arrest on 18 March 1997 was planted there, and that the charges against him were brought to punish him for his relationship to a prominent dissident in exile.
