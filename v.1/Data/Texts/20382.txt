 Javier Torres Cruz was released on 13 December 2008, after being abducted on 3 December. On his return, he had a number of bruises, particularly on his hands, and complained of strong abdominal pains. His family stated that he was blindfolded and did not know where he had been held, and they believed that those who detained him were soldiers. Amnesty International believes that Javier Torres Cruz and his relatives are still in danger."
