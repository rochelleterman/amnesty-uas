 There is serious concern for the safety of members of the Partido Revolucionario Democratico (PRD) in Chiapas state in the run-up to municipal elections scheduled for 15 October 1995. PRD members and their families have been attacked and threatened with death and fears for their safety have been heightened by the killing of two PRD members in recent days."
