 NA 
 Pulat Akhunov was sentenced on 17 August 1993 to three years in a labour camp for illegal possession of narcotics and assaulting a prison guard. There is continued concern that these charges, and a previous charge, were fabricated by the authorities to punish him for his opposition political activities. There are also concerns about reports that during his trial, his lawyer was obstructed from calling important witnesses for the defence. "
