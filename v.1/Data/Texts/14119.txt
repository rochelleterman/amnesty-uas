 On 12 May 1993, Milorad Mutascu was released from pre-trial detention by the County Court of Timisoara. According to his lawyer, he had not been ill-treated by police while in detention. The trial of Milorad Mutascu, aged 22, and Mirel Ciprian Cucu, aged 17, under Article 200 of the Romanian Penal Code, has been postponed until 9 June 1993. Should they again be imprisoned, following the trial, they would be considered prisoners of conscience. "
