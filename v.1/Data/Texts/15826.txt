 The above-named, ethnic Albanians, were tried by the district court of Pristina in Kosovo Province on charges of undermining the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and of terrorism and sabotage. Seven were found guilty of the first charge on 29 October 1992; the other two charges were dropped. One, Deme Tolaj, was released; the others received sentences of between one and six years' imprisonment. All had been in detention since January 1992. At their trial, most alleged that they had been ill-treated or tortured. Some of the accused admitted that they had visited Albania in November 1991 for military training and to obtain weapons, which they maintained were for self-defence. Lawyers for the defence complained of many violations of the Law of Criminal Procedure. "
