 UA 338/93 - Indonesia: possible extrajudicial execution / fear of further extrajudicial executions: Hans Soaf | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The body of Hans Soaf, a young man from Betaf, Irian Jaya, was found buried in a shallow grave in the forest near Waskee. It was found a few days after his arrest on or shortly before 23 July 1993 by the Indonesian security forces. There are fears that he may have been extrajudicially executed, and that other members of the civilian population in Irian Jaya may also be at risk. "
