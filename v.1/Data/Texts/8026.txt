 There is continued concern for the safety of Cecilia Valenzuela, a journalist writing for the weekly magazine Caretas, who has reportedly received further death threats. On 1 May 1993, while celebrating her birthday at a friend's house, a bouquet of flowers was delivered with a note which stated ""you are going to die"". This threat follows previous ones made by telephone, after the publication by the magazine of a report on a death squad operating inside the army, believed to be responsible for the ""disappearance"" and death of nine students and a lecturer.
