 USA (Missouri): Death penalty: Robert T Sidebottom | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Robert Sidebottom is scheduled to be executed in Missouri on 15 November. He was sentenced for the murder of his grandmother in 1985. Sidebottom has been without legal representation and therefore unable to file an appeal against his execution. Sidebottom is reported to suffer from borderline mental retardation and to be easily manipulated. There are doubts about his degree of culpability and understanding of the crime for which he was sentenced to death."
