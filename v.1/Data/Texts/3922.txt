 Brazil: Further information on: Fear for safety and new concern: Forced eviction | Amnesty International 
 Landowners have secured court orders for the eviction of the 100 Guarani people who have been occupying a portion of the Floresta ranch, situated on the Sombrerito indigenous territory, and also a second group of Guarani occupying a section of land in the nearby Yvy Katu territory, in Mato Grosso do Sul state. Federal police are reportedly preparing to act on these orders in the near future: previous evictions have been violent, and the Guarani could end up destitute.
