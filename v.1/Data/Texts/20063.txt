 The members of a network of activists in Guatemala are in grave danger. Three members of the network have been killed since October 2009. Most recently, FRENA member Octavio Roblero was killed on 17 February. The motive for the attacks is not clear, and nobody has been brought to justice for any of the killings. Other leading members of FRENA have received death threats."
