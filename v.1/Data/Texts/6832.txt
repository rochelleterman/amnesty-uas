 There is concern at the indiscriminate use of lethal force against civilians by attaches (armed men licensed by the army to carry guns). According to reports, on 8 September an attack took place outside City Hall where a ceremony had just taken place to reinstate Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul. Attaches reportedly attempted to pull aides of Evans Paul from his car. Shots were fired and several people were beaten. Bayard Edrice, an associate of Evans Paul, and one other man were killed, and eleven others were injured, but the exact circumstances are unknown. About 200 attaches had reportedly been occupying City Hall for six days and are alleged to have threatened to kill Evans Paul if he tried to retake office. "
