 Jos_ Serrano Salgado, a member of the Ecuadorian non-governmental organization (NGO) Centro de Derechos Econ—micos y Sociales (CDES), Economic and Social Rights Centre, was reportedly threatened with death on 25 April. The threats are believed to be linked to the organization's support for the Sarayaku indigenous community in Pastaza province, which opposes plans by a foreign oil company to drill in their territory.
