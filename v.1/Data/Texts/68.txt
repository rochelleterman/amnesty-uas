 UA 406/94 - Angola: extrajudicial executions by government officers and deliberate and arbitrary killings by UNITA: Eduardo Domingos and others | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned that both government and UNITA forces are deliberately killing suspected opponents while preparing to sign a new peace agreement for Angola. Government forces allegedly gunned down Eduardo Domingos, a professor of economics and UNITA supporter who had been imprisoned and released in 1993, in Lubango in October 1994. UNITA troops are said to ahve executed prisoners before fleeing from the stronghold, Huambo, captured by government forces in November 1994. Government forces, according to UNITA, have extrajudicially executed suspected UNITA sympathizers in Huambo and Uige."
