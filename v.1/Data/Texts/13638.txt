 Information has been received that Maung Maung Than and Par Pa who were arrested in Bangkok both agreed to go the the ""safe area"" in Rachaburi Province, established by the Thai authorities in September 1991 to house Burmese refugees. On 6 July a letter from the Thai embassy in London gave information about the ""safe area"", and claimed that Ko Htay Lwin, who died in hospital after being brought there from the Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) had received proper medical treatment, giving the date of his death as 29 May 1993 not 24 April as previously reported. There is still concern that he may not have received adequate medical treatment in detention from 9 April until 22 May, and this concern is heightened by the continuing poor conditions at IDC. "
