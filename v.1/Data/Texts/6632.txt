 According to reports, on 2 September 1993 a bomb was placed in the offices of GAM in Guatemala City, not far from the offices of FAMDEGUA. Although no one was hurt, a few hours later employees at FAMDEGUA began to receive anonymous phone calls threatening to place a bomb in their building if they did not close their offices. On 11 September armed men fired shots at the home of Nineth Montenegro, President of GAM and spokesperson for the Foro Multisectorial Social, the Social Multisectorial Forum. Further shots were fired at her home on 14 September, reportedly by a new so-called paramilitary group, the Instancia de Depuracion y Castigo, Appeal Group for Purification and Punishment. There is serious concern for her safety and that of the members of the above human rights organizations. "
