 On 10 September a bomb exploded at the offices of the AGJ in Guatemala City, apparently causing serious damage to furniture and documentation, but without injuring anyone. On the same day, two armed men reportedly arrived at the Primer Asentamiento de desplazados Internos Mario Antonio Diaz, the First Settlement of Internal Displaced Peoples Mario Antonio Diaz, and asked to speak to the leaders of CONDEG. A few minutes later they apparently fired into the air, thus trying to intimidate the many families living in the settlement. "
