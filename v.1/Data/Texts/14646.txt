Yavuz Bing_l was  taken for          treatment at the Bing_l State hospital,  believed to be   related to torture he experienced in      custody. All    eight   men  were taken before a judge and   remanded     into custody on 27 September. They have not   yet seen a    lawyer, and are therefore at risk of        further     torture and  ill-treatment.
