 NA 
 The Chinese authorities in Lhasa have reportedly detained a large number of Tibetans in the days preceding the arrival in Lhasa on 16 May 1993 of a delegation of European Community (EC) delegates. Among the detainees, who appear to be held in incommunicado detention and are believed to be at risk of ill-treatment, are an elderly man, Lobsang Yonten, and a travel agency employee, Gendun Rinchen. Both men may be prisoners of conscience detained for exercising their right to freedom of expression. "
