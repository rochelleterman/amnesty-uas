 Sri Lanka:  Enforced Disappearance: Stephen Sunthararaj (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 7 May 2009, Stephen Sunthararaj was abducted by five men whilst travelling in his lawyer's car in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo. He had been released without charge from police custody a few hours beforehand and has not been heard from since. Amnesty International fears that he has been subjected to enforced disappearance because of his work at the Centre for Human Rights and Development in Colombo. "
