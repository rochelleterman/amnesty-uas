 Colombia: Further information on fear for safety: Civilian population in the municipality of Segovia | Amnesty International 
 New names: Nazareno Rivera, trade union activist; Jaime Ortiz Londono, Jesus Ramiro Zapata, human rights activists: The whereabouts of Jamie Ortiz Londono, a coordinator of the Segovia Human Rights Committee, have not been known since 9 March 1997. There is concern that he may be one of six people killed on 10 March by the Colombian army in the hamlet of Canaveral, municipality of Remedios, in unclear circumstances. Reports also indicate that Nazareno Rivera, a trade unionist from Segovia, is also among those killed. Jesus Ramiro Zapata, another member of the Segovia Human Rights Committee, was forced to leave town as a result of continued death threats and harassment by the army and allied paramilitary forces.
