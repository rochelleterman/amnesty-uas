 On 24 June, the five men were secretly transferred out of Malawi in the custody of US government agents. It is not known where they are being held. They have had no access to lawyers since their arrest in Malawi on 22 June. Their transfer out of Malawi violated national law and circumvented any formal human rights protections.
