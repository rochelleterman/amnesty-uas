 Further information on UA 137/93 (ASA 25/17/93, 27 April) - South Korea: prisoner of conscience / fear of ill-treatment: Hwang Suk-yong | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Hwang Suk-yong was held for interrogation by the Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) from 27 April 1993 until 14 May when he was referred to the prosecution for further questioning. He was not ill-treated while in ANSP custody, but there is concern that he may be questioned for an excessive period (up to 50 days) before he is charged. There is also concern about a public statement made by the ANSP which appears to have violated his right to be presumed innocent before trial. "
