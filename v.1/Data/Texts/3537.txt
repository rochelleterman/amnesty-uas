 Eritrea: ""Disappearance"", Ali Mohamed Saleh (m), aged 63, Ministry   of Foreign Affairs official | Amnesty International 
 Ali Mohamed Saleh has not been seen since 4 April, when he left home to go to work in the Eritrean capital, Asmara. It is feared that he has been abducted by the security police and detained in secret, along with many other suspected critics of the government. He is a diabetic who takes tablets daily, and carries only a small supply with him. He may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment in custody.
