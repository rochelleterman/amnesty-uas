 The above-named are allegedly being held in secret detention at a number of Guatemalan military installations, according to the testimonies of two combatatants of the armed opposition group the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (UNRG), who escaped from unacknowledged detention. According to these testimonies, both they and other prisoners were subjected to torture and death threats to force them to collaborate with the military in identifiying and apprehending susected members or supporters of the armed opposition. Now that the testimonies have been made public, there are fears that the unacknowledged prisoners named in their statements may be extrajudicially executed. "
