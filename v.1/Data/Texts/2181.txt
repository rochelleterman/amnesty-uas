 UA 116/93 - South Africa: extrajudicial executions: Sam Tambane, Olympic Chidi, and four others (names unknown) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Sam Tambane, Secretary of the ANC's Soweto subregional branch, Olympic Chidi, a resident of Soweto, and two others were killed on 14 April 1993 when members of the South African Police opened fire on marchers, who had gathered outside Protea Police Station in Soweto to mourn the death of Chris Hani, the leader of the South African Communist Party who was assassinated on 10 April. More than 200 other marchers were injured, two of whom subsequently died of their injuries. Although police claimed to have opened fire in self-defence, none of the foreign journalists or other independent witnesses heard any shots from the crowd. AI is concerned that the police used lethal force unnecessarily and with the intention of killing and wounding people in the crowd. "
