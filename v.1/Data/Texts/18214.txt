 Palestinian Authority / Occupied Territories: Death penalty/Unfair trial, Khaled al-'Akka | Amnesty International 
 Khaled al-?Akka was condemned to death on 12 August for collaborating with the Israeli security services, after he confessed to passing on information that led to the killing of a member of President Yasser Arafat's bodyguard. He is not entitled to appeal, and he could be executed at any time, if President Arafat ratifies his sentence. He received an unfair and summary trial before the Higher State Security Court in Gaza.
