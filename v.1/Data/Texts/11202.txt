"India: Death penalty 
 India: Death penalty | Amnesty International 
 Two sisters, Renuka Kiran Shinde and Seema Mohan Gavit, face execution after the India's Supreme Court upheld their death sentences. If the Supreme Court, which has upheld the verdicts of two lower courts, rejects the sisters' plea for a review of their case, their last hope would be their petitions for mercy, submitted to the President's office five years ago, which are still pending. The President and the Governor have the power to commute their sentences.
