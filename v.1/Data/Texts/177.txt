 NA 
 More than 200 unarmed civilians are reported to have been massacred during a night-time raid on 6 March 1994 in the Kamenge zone of Bujumbura. Virtually all the victims, who included women and children, are said to be members of the majority Hutu ethnic group. Government and other sources in Bujumbura have accused the army of responsibility. Military commanders have reportedly denied that the security forces were involved. Neither the military nor government authorities are known to have initiated any formal investigation."
