 Malaysia: Fear of forcible return/ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Approximately 217 people, including refugees and          asylum-seekers, were detained on 25 June in a raid on the Chin Refugee Centre in the capital, Kuala Lumpur.  They   are mainly Chin people from Myanmar, recognised as        refugees by the UNHCR. Among them are five pregnant women and at least 10 children. They are at risk of corporal    punishment for breaking Malaysia's immigration laws, and  of being forcibly returned to Myanmar, where they would   be at grave risk of torture.
