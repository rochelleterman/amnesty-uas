 Omer Parlacik, Zehra Aydin (f), Salami Guleryuz, Serdar Karaci, Arif Cakmak, Ramazan Seyyidhan, Turan Tanrikulu, Ramazan Kartalmas, Ekir B, Suad Gundogan, Ozkan Coskun, Faruk Yaygin, Aziz Kaya, Nemir Ozmen, Mahsum Bilen, Mehmet Birakci, Adnan Gul, Onder Ozcelik, Yuksel Bulut, H Mehmet Yaguz, Ali Bingol, Siksef Karakus, Mehmet Ali Yagman, Nihat Cagirlayan, Asef Karasik, Emin Dalgic: Since 10 June 1996, dozens of students from the Dicle University in Diyarbakir have been detained. Although some have been released, the 26 persons named above are believed to be still in custody at Diyarbakir Police Headquarters and at the Anti-Riot Branch of Diyarbakir Police. Fears for their safety in custody have been heightened by reports that some were ill-treated while being detained, and that one has since been  hospitalized. These detentions are apparently aimed at suppressing public demonstrations in support of political prisoners on hunger-strike in Turkey.
