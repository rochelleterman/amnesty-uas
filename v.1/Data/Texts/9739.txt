 AI has learned why Charles Stamper, scheduled to be executed on 28 October 1992, has been granted a stay of execution. The stay is to allow the Governor of Virginia, Douglas Wilder, to consider information about Charles Stamper's medical condition before he decides whether to grant clemency. Charles Stamper is partially and irreversibly paralyzed as a result of a fight with another death row prisoner in 1988 and, if executed, he would have to be taken to the death chamber in a wheelchair.
