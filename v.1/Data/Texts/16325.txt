 On 5 February, a single mortar shell fell on the market off Marsal Tito street in the centre of Sarajevo. Sixty-eight people were reportedly killed, and nearly 200 injured. Almost all the victims appear to have been civilians. Bosnian Serb forces are thought to have been responsible. United Nations Military monitors are reported to have concluded that the three shells that fell on an aid queue in the Dobrinja district of Sarajevo on 4 February were fired from Bosnian Serb mortars in Lukavica."
