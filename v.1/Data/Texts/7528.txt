 On 15 June 1997 Fidel Garcia Ramirez, secretary for Agrarian Affairs in the state of Guerrero for the Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD), a legal opposition party, was arrested in Xocoyolzintla, municipality of Ahuacuotzingo, state of Guerrero. He was arrested by members of the Public Security Police but was then handed over to members of the Mexican Army. He is reported to have been tortured to extract a confession of his supposed links with an armed opposition group. He is reportedly now being held in Chilpancingo prison and there is grave concern for his safety.
