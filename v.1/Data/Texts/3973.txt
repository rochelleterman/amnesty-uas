 UA 422/94 - Brazil: torture / fear for safety: Carlos Eduardo Rodrigues da Silva, Ismael Soares Rodrigues, Wanderlei Batista and others from Borel shanty town, Rio de Janeiro | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Fears for the safety of civilians caught in the anti-crime crackdown by the security forces have been heightened by reports of the torture and ill-treatment of residents of the Borel shanty town, Rio de Janeiro, during an anti-drugs raid. More than 1000 soldiers and police occupied Borel between 25 and 28 November 1995. A local priest and nuns have reporeted hearing and seeing people being tortured. Five local residents, including those named above, denounced their torture - including kicking, beating, drowning and electric shocks - to the local police. AI is calling for these reports to be investigated."
