 On 3 April 2010, three activists and a journalist who attended a meeting opposing the construction of a dam in Jalisco state, western Mexico, were threatened by men claiming to be federal employees. Three days later, an organization working with communities near the dam site received an anonymous threat. The four individuals and staff of the organization are in danger."
