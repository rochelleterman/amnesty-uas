 Malaysia: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/fear of incommunicado detention.	 | Amnesty International 
 Malaysian police reportedly arrested a sergeant in the Malaysian armed forces on 18 January, and a library security guard on 20 January, under the Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows for indefinite detention without charge or trial. It is not known where they are being held, or whether they have access to legal representation or to their families. Amnesty International is concerned that the two men are at risk of torture or ill-treatment during police interrogation.
