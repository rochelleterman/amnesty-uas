 Rony Guerra Blancas, aged 23, and Milagros Flor Tupac Gonzalez, aged 22, student leaders at the Universidad Nacional del Centro, were reportedly arrested on 11 and 12 January 1993 in Huancayo by armed men believed to be linked to the security forces. They have not been seen since. Their parents have denounced the incidents to police and military authorities, who deny having detained the students. Habeas corpus petitions have been presented to the examining magistrate in Huancayo. "
