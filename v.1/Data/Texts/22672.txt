 NA 
 Khamisa Mohammed Sawadi, a 75-year-old Syrian woman, along with two younger Saudi Arabian men known only as Fahad, aged 24, and Hadyan, have had their sentences of flogging and imprisonment reimposed and confirmed on appeal after the Court of Cassation in Saudi Arabia sent the case back for retrial to the lower court which first heard it. If the recently established Supreme Court upholds their sentences, they will be imprisoned and at imminent risk of flogging."
