 Bulat Sultanovich Chilaev (m) & Aslan Israilov (m) are feared to have been ""disappeared"" after they were arbitrarily detained on 9 April by Chechen or Russian federal security forces. The security forces have denied all knowledge of the men's detention, and both are in danger of torture and ill-treatment.
