 NA 
 Women’s rights activist Fatemeh Masjedi was arrested on 28 January 2011 while travelling from Qom to Tehran. Her current place of detention is unknown, but it is feared she may have been arrested to begin serving a six-month prison sentence imposed for her peaceful collection of signatures for a petition demanding an end to discrimination against women in law in Iran. If so, she is a prisoner of conscience who should be released immediately and unconditionally."
