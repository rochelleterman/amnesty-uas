 Thailand / Myanmar: Further information on refoulement / fear of refoulement and new concern: fear of ill-treatment: forcible return of Burmese refugees to Myanmar: Ah Bo | Amnesty International 
 On 2 November 1996 Thai Rangers again repatriated a group of 185  Akha and Lahu refugees to Myanmar. Amnesty International fears that the villagers remain at risk of arbitrary detention and possible ill-treatment in Myanmar and that Ah Bo, a 42-year-old Lahu male villager detained during the army raid of 20 October, may be facing ill-treatment in custody. His current whereabouts are unknown.
