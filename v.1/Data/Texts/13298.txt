 Singapore: Possible imminent execution / Unfair trial, Vignes s/o Mourthi (m) aged 23, Malaysian national | Amnesty International 
 Vignes s/o Mourthi may be at risk of imminent execution, following the recent rejection of his appeal for clemency to the President of Singapore. On 12 September, his lawyer lodged a motion for a re-trial, on the grounds that there had been a miscarriage of justice and that he had not received a fair trial. However the motion was rejected. On 19 September, his lawyer is due to file another application for a retrial with the High Court. If this application is rejected, Vignes s/o Mourthi could be executed shortly afterwards
