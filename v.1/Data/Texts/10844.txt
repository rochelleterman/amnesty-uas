 NA 
 Zhang Lin, a pro-democracy activist and prisoner of conscience, administratively detained in Anhui province, has been ill-treated in the labour camp, according to a letter he smuggled out which was cited in a Reuters' report of 22 November 1994. In his letter he reportedly says that for one hour on 1 November, a guard at the Nanhu labour camp repeatedly punched and kicked him and subjected him to electric shocks with an electric baton. He is apparently in ill-health and has repeatedly been denied medical care."
