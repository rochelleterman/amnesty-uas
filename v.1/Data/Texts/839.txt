 Ethiopia: Further information on Fear of torture or ill-treatment / ""disappearance"" / prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Four Ethiopian Teachers' Association (ETA) members        (Meqcha Mengistu (m), Anteneh Getnet (m), Tilahun Ayalew and Woldie Dana (m)) who were arrested in December 2006, are now known to have been released in March, but three have since been rearrested. The fourth ETA official, Tilahun Ayalew, is in hiding. Amnesty International believes that the three teachers who are being detained are prisoners of conscience detained for participating in legal ETA trade union activities. They are at risk of torture or ill-treatment.
