 The 10 men named in this Urgent Action were arrested by Military Intelligence agents in August 2008. One of them, Mohammed Amin al-Shawa, died in custody in January 2009. His death has increased concern for the safety of the remaining nine detainees who, according to reports received by Amnesty International, may be held at the Palestine Branch, a Military Intelligence interrogation and detention centre in Damascus which is notorious for torture."
