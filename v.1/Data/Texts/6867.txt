 Victor Edmond, an employee of a Canadian humanitarian organization CECI, ""disappeared"" in Haiti on 7 June 1994. He was last seen at a military road-block set up by military-backed gunmen. Other people stopped at the roadblock report seeing a black man with hands and feet bound. However, the description of his clothes did not appear to match those Victor Edmond was wearing. The gunmen at the roadblock reportedly included men known to be close to General Raoul Cedras."
