 Equatorial Guinea: Enforced disappearance/incommunicado detention/fear of torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Fabián Ovono Esono and José Ndong, who fled from Equatorial Guinea to Nigeria in 2003 to escape a crackdown on people suspected of involvement in a coup against the president, were reportedly abducted in Nigeria and returned to Equatorial Guinea in December 2008. The Equatorial Guinean authorities have not confirmed that they have been detained, or where they are. However, according to information received by Amnesty International, since their abduction and subsequent transfer to Equatorial Guinea, they have been held in prison in Bata, the main city on the country's mainland."
