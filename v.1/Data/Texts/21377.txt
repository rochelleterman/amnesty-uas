 Turkey: Torture/ ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ozgur Karakaya, Cihan Gun and Engin Ceber were among a group of people arrested on 28 September 2008 during a demonstration and press conference in Istanbul. A lawyer for the three men told Amnesty International that the men were tortured in detention. On 10 October Engin Ceber died as a result of injuries he sustained while in detention. Ozgur Karakaya and Cihan Gun are still in custody at Metris Prison and continue to be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment, and require access to an urgent independent medical examination and appropriate medical treatment as required."
