 Nalfi Lopez Narvaez has not been seen since 14 May 1995, when he was arrested by a police patrol. The sergeant in command of the patrol reportedly said that he was arrested because he looked exactly like somebody wanted for criminal activities but that he was later released. However, his whereabouts remain unknown despite his enquiries made by his relatives to police and military authorities. There is serious concern for his safety."
