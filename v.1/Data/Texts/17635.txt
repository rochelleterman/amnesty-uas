 Ahmad Sulayman Musa Qatamesh has been issued with a six-month administrative detention order, thirteen months after his arrest. At a trial session on 14 October 1993 the judge ordered that he be released on bail, reportedly arguing that the prosecutor had failed to provide evidence against him justifying his continued detention. His decision to release him on bail was confirmed on 20 October. However, the Israel military authorities decided to place him under administrative detention for six months. He thus remains in detention while trial proceedings continue. His trial started on 3 December 1992 but has been postponed several times. "
