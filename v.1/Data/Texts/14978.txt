 NA 
 AI is concerned for the safety of Necat Altun, a Kurd from Mardin province, and his 16-year-old daughter, Hediye, who have been in unacknowledged detention in Istanbul since 20 July 1995. Officers of the Anti-Terror Branch came to the home of Necat Altun in Istanbul. They searched the house and took away some printed material and a weapon. They then detained Necat Altun and his daughter. The family has not been able to obtain confirmation of their detention or news of their present whereabouts. It is feared that they are being interrogated under torture at the Anti-Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters."
