 India: Further information on torture / fear for safety: Nazir Ahmed Sheikh | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Government of India has responded to Urgent Action 54/95, issued on 1 March 1995, concerning the alleged torture of Nazir Ahmed Sheikh. AI is concerned that there are serious discrepancies between the account of events provided by the government and the allegations made by the victim and documented by human rights organizations in Jammu and Kashmir. The government has given no indication that an independent and impartial investigation was carried out into these very serious allegations of torture. It has failed to provide documentary evidence to support its claims, or details of the medical care reportedly provided to Nazir Ahmed Sheikh immediately after his arrest."
