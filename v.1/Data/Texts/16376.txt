 AI is still gravely concerned for the safety of Serbs remaining in the Krajina region, as reports continue of extrajudical executions, ill-treatment and acts of intimidation perpetrated by the Croatian forecs. This concern is further heightened by the poor security conditions in the area. An Amnesty International delegation which visited the area around the town of Knin recently found the small and largely elderly Serbian population living in a situation of fear and great insecurity."
