 Mexico: Fear for safety / death threats / arbitrary detentions | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International fears for the safety of members of  the community of El Portal, in Chiapas State, after they  were attacked, apparently by supporters of the ruling     Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), Institutional Revolutionary Party. Police arrested 20 members of the    Indigenous Peasant Organization Front. Sixteen of the     detainees were subsequently released but four of them,    Genaro Guti?rrez Aguilar, Ramiro de Le´n de Le´n, Luis    Zunun Mart_nez, and Elfego Zunun Mart_nez, were charged   with various crimes and transferred to a prison.
