 Sierra Leone: Death penalty / legal concern: three soldiers sentenced to death | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned that three soldiers sentenced to death by a military court could be executed in the near future.  They have no right of appeal to a higher court.  Three border guards, whose names AI does not yet know, were sentenced to death by firing squad on 26 October after being convicted by a court-martial of murder, conspiracy and robbery.  They were accused of shooting three civilians during a raid on a village in March 1995 and looting rice and other food.  Trials before courts-martial allow no right of appeal to a higher court."
