 Mongolia: Further information on: Medical/ Legal Concerns/ Prisoner of Conscience, Lodoisambuu Sanjaasuren | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has received conflicting reports on the level of medical attention that Lodoisambuu Sanjaasuren is receiving in detention for his serious heart condition. The Mongolian government has claimed that he is receiving adequate medical treatment. However, this assertion is contradicted by his Sanjaasuren's family, who say that he has been denied access to his doctor since 3 March, and that he is in a ""critical"" condition. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience and a human rights defender, as he was arrested simply for protecting the rights of his client.
