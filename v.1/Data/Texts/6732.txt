 Saurel Guerrier, aged 17, was reportedly shot and killed on 15 January 1994 in Port-au-Prince. According to reports, his assailant, known as Jodell, is a member of the Front Revolutionnaire pour l'Avancement et le Progres Haitien (FRAPH), a group widely reported as being a front for the attaches. Saurel Guerrier was a resident at the ""Centre d'Education Populaire"", one of three children's homes in Port-au-Prince. Sources in Haiti have suggested that his assailant may have mistakenly believed that he was connected to the children's home ""Lafanmi Selavi"", which was founded by president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and which has been the subject of frequent attacks and harassment. There is now concern for the safety of all children and staff at the two children's homes."
