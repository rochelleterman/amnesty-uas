 Romania: Roma relocated to live in unsafe old office | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Between 11 and 13 May, 70 Romani families were moved from their homes in the informal settlement of Craica in Baia Mare, northwestern Romania, to an inadequate and unsafe old office building. Remaining Romani residents are being pressured to move into similar buildings, through threats and intimidation by self-proclaimed representatives of the communities."
