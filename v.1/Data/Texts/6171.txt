 Guatemala: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 The 15-year-old daughter of trade unionists has been raped by men allegedly linked to the management of the plantation where they work. The rape is believed to be part of management intimidation of union activists pursuing legal action against the plantation: in March this year the plantation manager allegedly offered a reward to any of the plantation's private security guards who raped a female associated with the union. Amnesty International believes the family and all union members are in grave danger.
