 EXTRA 16/94 - Turkey: fear of torture: Masallah Duygu, Metin Elci, Veysel Ugurlu | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The three young men named above, all workers in a Mersin bread factory, have been detained recently and there are fears that they are being interrogated under torture, presumably at Mersin Police headquarters. Security forces all over Turkey are making hundreds of arrests in the run-up the the local elections on 27 March. Anybody suspected of sympathizing with or supporting the PKK is a target. AI is concerned by reports that Metin Elci and his cousin Veysel Ugurlu were severely beaten after arrest. Metin Elci was detained in 1992 and allegedly tortured in police custody."
