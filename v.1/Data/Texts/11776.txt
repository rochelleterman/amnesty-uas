 At least 57 protestors who entered the Russian Embassy in Jakarta on 7 December have left the embassy and have been taken to Jakarta Police Headquarters where they are believed to be currently being interrogated. It is thought that the group had been given assurances by the authorities that if they left the embassy their safety would be guaranteed. However, in the past, such guarantees have proved insufficient to protect individuals from torture or ill-treatment and there is concern for their safety. A group of 58 East Timorese and Indonesian demonstrators in the Dutch Embassy are still refusing to leave. There is no further information on the whereabouts of the others arrested, although it is now believed that Rui Lopes, Jose Valdo, Caetano, Teodoro Soares and Cipriano Cardoso were among those arrested."
