 There is concern that the seven members of a human rights organization and trade union named above, detained after peaceful Labour-day demonstrations on 1 May 1994, may be prisoners of conscience and that their trial may fall short of international fair trial standards. At the first hearing in Errachidia on 5 May they were granted bail by the court, but the prosecution appealed, and they remain in detention. The trial is now set for 17 May."
