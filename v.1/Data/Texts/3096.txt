 UA 277/92 - Togo: fear of torture: Captain Esso Charles Pello | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Captain Esso Charles Pello, secretary of the Togolese Armed Forces and former head of the Intelligence Services, was arrested on 28 July 1992 in Lome. He was transferred to the Brigade de Gendarmerie in Kara, where, reports suggest, he has been subjected to electric shocks, beatings and deprived of food. He was taken to hospital, allegedly in a coma, where he received medical treatment. He is currently detained without charge or trial at the military camp in Kara. His family has not been allowed to visit him. Captain Pello is apparently suspected of having links with the President's political opponents. "
