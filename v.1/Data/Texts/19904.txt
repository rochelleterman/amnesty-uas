 Colombia: Forced eviction | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Sources in the Curvaradó region learned at a local meeting on 11 June that local police were preparing an eviction notice, which they planned to serve on 18 June, on the community of Caracolí, which consists of over 100 people, in the Curvaradó region of Chocó Department. This eviction notice had been ordered by a local judge despite the central government's repeated recognition that the residents of Caracolí legally own their lands and therefore have a right to remain there.
