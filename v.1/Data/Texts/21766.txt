 Bahrain: Further information: Political activists on trial allege torture | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A group of 23 detained opposition activists on trial in Bahrain have alleged that they were again subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in prison following their first trial session on 28 October 2010. They allege that the new abuses were committed against them in reprisal for having disclosed their earlier torture and other ill-treatment. They continue to have very limited access to their lawyers and there are continuing fears for their safety in prison."
