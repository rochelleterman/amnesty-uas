 Amnesty International is gravely concerned for the safety of photographer Sergio Kowalewski and his family after they received three threatening phone calls. The death threats are reportedly linked to photographs taken by Sergio Kowalewski during disturbances in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires province on 26 June and clearly show police involvement in the events leading to the killing of Dario Santillan and Maximiliano Costeki.
