 Mahmut Havuc, a 16-year-old high school student, was detained at his home in Mersin on 15 March and is now held in unacknowledged police custody. It is feared he is being tortured while under interrogation in incommunicado detention. Police reportedly beat Mahmut and his father before he was taken away. When his parents went to the station, they were told that their son was not there."
