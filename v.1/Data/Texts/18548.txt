 The above, aged 59, and believed to be detained in al-Mezze Prison, is reported to be in deteriorating health. Mustafa Tawfiq Fallah, a former officer in the Syrian army, was  charged with ""offences against the security of the state and public order"" and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment in 1970 in connection with the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party.
