 Burhan Mutlu and two other men have been held in incommunicado detention in Istanbul since 13 October 1995. It is feared that they are being interrogated under torture by the Anti-Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters. Mutlu is said to have had contacts with the People's Democracy Party (HADEP), a legal poltical party with a predominantly Kurdish membership working for the civil and political rights of the Kurdish minority. In recent years more than 100 officials and members of HADEP and its two predecessor parties have been killed in unclarified circumstances."
