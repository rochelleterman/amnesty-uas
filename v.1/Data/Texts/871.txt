 Several hundred demonstrators were arrested at the Central High Court in Addis Ababa on 20 September 1994. It is believed those named above and many others are prisoners of conscience and there is concern they may be ill-treated in detention. They are being held incommunicado in Sendafa Police College and have not been brought before a court within the 48-hours prescribed by law. They were peacefully demonstrating support for Professor Asrat Woldeyes, chairman of the opposition political party All-Amhara People's Organization (AAP0) who is already serving time for inciting violence, a charge he denies, and was facing a further trial on similar charges."
