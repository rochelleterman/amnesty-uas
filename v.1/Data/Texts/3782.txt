 Wagner dos Santos, 23, a key witness to the killing of 8 street children in Rio de Janeiro in July 1994 (the ""Candelaria massacre""), cannot leave the hospital where he has been treated after the attempt on his life in December 1994. This is because the state authorities would not provide him with adequate protection and alternative shelter. He was discharged on 5 January 1995 but cannot leave hospital as threats have been made against him. The hospital may not be able to keep him much longer as his bed is needed. Wagner dos Santos still needs major surgery for facial paralysis caused by the bullet wounds. No public hospital is apparently able to perform this surgery at present."
