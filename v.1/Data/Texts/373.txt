"Cameroon: Further information on prisoner of conscience / fear of further prisoners of conscience: Eyoum Ngangue 
 NA 
 Eyoum Ngangue, a journalist working for the independent Le Messager newspaper and its satirical supplement Le Messager Popoli, is still imprisoned at the Central Prison, New-Bell, Douala. He was arrested in Douala on 22 January 1997 after having been sentenced in early October 1996 to a one year prison sentence and a fine by the Court of Appeal after being convicted of insulting the President of the Republic and members of the National Assembly. Another journalist sentenced with him, Pius Njawe, was conditionally released on 15 November 1996. Both men have appealed against their sentence and conviction to the Supreme Court. There is concern that Eyoum Ngangue may be a prisoner of conscience detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression.
