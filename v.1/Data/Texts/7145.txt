  Steve Shaw, Desmond Taylor, Beresford Whyte.
Steve Shaw and Desmond Taylor, who were scheduled to be   hanged on 13 April 1999, have had their stays of          execution extended until 4 May so that the Jamaican Court of Appeal can hear their constitutional motions. The      Jamaican High Court had dismissed their constitutional    motions on 12 April, but granted a stay of execution      until 16 April.
Beresford Whyte, who was scheduled to be hanged on 15     April, was granted a 10-day stay of execution that day,   after a constitutional motion was filed on his behalf in  the Jamaican High Court.
