 Buddhist monk U Gambira and his brother Aung Kyaw Kyaw have recently been charged under a vaguely worded security law. Similar politically motivated charges have also been brought against labour rights activist Su Su Nway, who is in poor health. They are being held in Yangonâ€™s Insein Prison, where they risk being tortured or otherwise ill-treated. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience, held solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression and peaceful association."
