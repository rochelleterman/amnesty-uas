 Yemen: Incommunicado detention / Fear of torture and other ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Two named men were arrested during the last three weeks and are now held incommunicado, putting them at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. According to sources in Yemen, journalist Salah Ahmed Yahya al-Shagladi is held at the Political Security Prison in the capital, Sana’a, while lecturer Hussein al-‘Agil is detained at the Criminal Investigation Unit, also in Sana’a. They appear to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression."
