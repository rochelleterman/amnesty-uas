 Bophuthatswana police have acknowledged that they are holding Nathaniel Ngakantsi, a prisoner of conscience, who was arrested following a demonstration calling for free political activity. His lawyers have paid his bail, but police have not yet brought him to court, and there is concern for his safety in incommunicado detention. On 18 February the ANC Mafikeng branch organized a picket reiterating the demands for free political activity and calling for the release of Nathaniel Ngakantsi. Police randomly assaulted the crowd who gathered. At least one person required medical treatment. Mr Modise, a cameraman for Bophuthatswana Television (Bop-TV) was arrested. Two ANC members, Pinky Mokoto and Paba Ngoganediwe, were also arrested, apparently from within the ANC offices."
