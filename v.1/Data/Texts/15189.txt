 UA 410/93 - Turkey: death penalty: Seyfettin Uzundiz (includes correction) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is serious concern at reports that for the first time in over nine years the Judicial Commission of the Turkish parliament on 17 November approved a death sentence. This would open the way for what would be the first execution in Western Europe in over nine years. Seyfettin Uzundiz was reportedly convicted in 1992 by a criminal court in Istanbul of murder and armed robbery. His file will now be sent to the plenary of the Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM - parliament) for approval, which requires a simple majority. Execution is by hanging and may be carried out immediately the death sentence has been ratified."
