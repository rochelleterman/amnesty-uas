 396 of the 415 Palestinians deported on 17 December 1992 remain stranded in harsh conditions in a makeshift camp in South Lebanon. On 28 January 1992 the Israeli High Court declared invalid the government decision of 16 December amending military regulations to allow deportations on security grounds with the right of appeal afforded only after the deportation is carried out. However, the Court also ruled that the individual deportation orders issued subsequently were not invalid but that appeal hearings must that place in the presence of the appellant. The ICRC and the United Nations have protested against the deportations. "
