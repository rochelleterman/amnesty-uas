 Sudan: Incommunicado detention/fear of torture or other ill-treatment/medical concern/possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Eight men [Nazmi Mohammed Hamed, Nayef Mohammed Hamed,    Al-Khatib Mohammed Salem, Maysara Izzeddin Mohammed       Mansur, Farouq Nouri, Hisham Abbas, Da'ud Suleima and     Isam Mohammed Faqir) were arrested on 28 August, as a     result of their opposition to the construction of the     Kajbar Dam in Sudan's Northern State. They have been held incommunicado since their arrest and may be at risk of    torture or ill-treatment. One of the detainees may not    have access to the medication he needs. Amnesty           International believes that the men may be prisoners of   conscience, detained solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression.
