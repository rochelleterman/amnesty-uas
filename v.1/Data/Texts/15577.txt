 Russia: Health concern/Denial of medical treatment: Mikhail Ivanovich Trepashkin (m), lawyer

 | Amnesty International 
 Lawyer Mikhail Trepashkin has been imprisoned since May 2005 on charges which appear to have been politically motivated. He suffers from chronic asthma, which has worsened in custody. On 29 May a judge ordered that he be hospitalized, but that evening he was forcibly removed from hospital by prison warders. Without adequate medical treatment his life may be in danger.
