 Wilson Mendez and his companion were reportedly detained on suspicion of being guerrillas by members of the armed forces in Doncello, Caqueta department, on 26 October 1992. They were taken to the base of the Florencia Battalion, where they were reportedly tortured: Wilson Mendez was shot in both legs in still unclarified circumstances. They were transferred to the local hospital, apparently as a result of protests by local people, where Wilson Mendez had an operation on his fractured legs. While still in hospital, the soldiers guarding the two reportedly attacked them in their beds, re-breaking Wilson Mendez's legs. Medical personnel who tried to stop the attack reportedly received death threats; paramilitaries have reportedly also threatened relatives of the two. "
