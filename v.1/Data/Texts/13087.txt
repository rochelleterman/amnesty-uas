 The three people named above have ""disappeared"" after their arrest in San Pablo City on 29 May 1994 reportedly by members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and officers from military intelligence. On 30 May relatives were told by the police captain that the three were suspected members of the New People's Army (NPA) and had been transferred to Camp Eldrid in Los Banos, Laguna in the custody of military intelligence. On 1 June, however, when inquiries were made there, military officials denied their detention."
