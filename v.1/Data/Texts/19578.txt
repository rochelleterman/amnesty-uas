 The leaders of the Zimbabwe Elections Support Network (ZESN), a coalition of 38 organizations that deployed local observers during the elections, are being harassed by the authorities, in an apparent attempt to prevent them observing a possible run-off election in the coming weeks.  Five days after their arrest, dozens of people who had sought refuge at the offices of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) remain in police custody, where they risk torture or other ill-treatment."
