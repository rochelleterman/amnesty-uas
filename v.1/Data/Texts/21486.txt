 The body of Zurab Ilaev was found on 10 December 2008 and taken to the morgue in the Chechen capital, Grozny. He had been suffocated, and there were marks on his body that might have been caused by torture and other ill-treatment. He had not been seen since 1 December. On 2 December, the bodies of his brothers Alvi and Azhdan Ilaev were shown when local television reported that two armed insurgents had been killed in a clash with the police. "
