 Myanmar: Further information on fear of ill-treatment / legal concern | Amnesty International 
 U Maung Maung Lay and Aung Myint (formerly U Muang Ung Myient) were released on 1 February. The other four men, U Win Naing, U Khin Maung, U Thein Tun and U Htay Kywe are still detained awaiting trial. The six men were originally arrested for writing a poem to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the death in custody of their NLD colleague U Tin Maung Win. It is believed they may be prisoners of conscience. There is concern at reports that Aung Myint was subjected to ill-treatment while in detention.
