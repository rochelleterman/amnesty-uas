 A former neighbour and a key witness in the trial of Basilia Ucán, an indigenous woman in Mexico, have been put under pressure by representatives of the State Prosecutor’s to make statements against her. Amnesty International is concerned for their safety as they continue to resist the pressure of officials and fears Basilia Ucán will be denied a fair trial."
