 The entire staff of the regional office of the Oromo Relief Association (ORA) in Dire Dawa were arrested by security forces between 26 September and 2 October 1993, apparently suspected of links with the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). It is not known where they are being held, but they are possibly in Hurso ""re-education camp"" near Dire Dawa. They have not been brought before a court or charged with any offence. There is concern that they may be tortured or ill-treated in custody, and detained without charge or trial for an indefinite period. They may also be prisoners of conscience. "
