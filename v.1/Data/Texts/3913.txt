 Several investigations into police action to evict 600 squatter peasant families from the Santa Elina estate in Corumbiara, Rondonia, on 9 August 1995, have confirmed that police were responsible for gross human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions. Eleven squatter peasants remain unaccounted for. AI's fear for their safety has been heightened by the discovery in the Tanaru River on 23 August of the body of Sergio Rodriguez Gomes two weeks after he was taken away by military police."
