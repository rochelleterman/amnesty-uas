 Rexhep Oruci and Salih Sokoli, along with Xhemail Haxhimustafa, Gani Mullabazi, Shaban Dana, Osman Vuciterna and Bajram Mexhuani have been charged with ""endangering Yugoslavia's territorial integrity"". They are accused of having created paramilitary forces with the aim of obtaining Kosovo's secession from Yugoslavia. Shaban Dana was reportedly tortured by police in Prizren and Ramadan Ndrecaj is apparently still in hospital, under police guard."
