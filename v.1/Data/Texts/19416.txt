 The authorities are attempting to shut down one of Angola's most active human rights organisation, the Association for Justice Peace and Democracy (AJPD). This organisation has played an important role in publicising human rights violations and promoting human rights awareness in Angola. It has also provided human rights training for the Angolan police force."
