 Hamma Hammami, arrested on 14 February 1994, finally received a medical examination on 8 March. He has now also received the medecines necessary for the treatment of his heart condition and kidney stones. There is concern, however, that owing to the excessive length of time between his alleged torture and the medical examination, the results of the latter, which found no trace of trauma, should not be used as evidence that torture did not occur."
