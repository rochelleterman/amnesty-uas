 UA 27/93 - Nigeria: death penalty: Major-General Zamani Lekwot and six others | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Seven members of the Kataf ethnic group, including retired army officer Major-General Zamani Lekwot, have been sentenced to death for murder in connection with religious riots in northern Nigeria in May 1992. AI is concerned that they have no right of appeal against the convictions and that their execution could therefore be imminent. "
