 UA 08/93 - Colombia: fear of ""disappearance"" / fear for safety: Marisela Cardenas Bustamente | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is serious concern for the safety of Marisela Cardenas Bustamente, aged 13, who was last seen going to visit a soldier friend stationed at the military base in Remedios, department of Antioquia, on 4 January 1994. Since that time her whereabouts remain unknown. When the town's ombudsman with two members of the local human rights committee and three of her relations went to the military base, they were threatened by the corporal in charge of the base. He denied any knowledge of the whereabouts of Marisela Cardenas Bustamente."
