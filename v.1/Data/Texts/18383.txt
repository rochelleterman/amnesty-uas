 Saudi Arabia: Death penalty/unfair trial, Abdullah Fandi al-Shammari | Amnesty International 
 Abdullah Fandi al-Shammari was sentenced to death by the Cassation Court for a murder committed 23 years ago. Amnesty International believes he was unfairly tried and should have his sentence commuted by King Abdullah who has the final decision in whether to ratify or commute the sentence.
