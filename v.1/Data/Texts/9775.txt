 AI has received more information about Delma Banks, black, who was convicted of the murder of a white man in 1980 and who is scheduled to be executed on 1 December 1992. Recent research by his attorneys and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. shows that prosecutors in Bowie County, Texas (where Banks was tried), systematically excluded blacks from juries for at least 6 years up to the time of his trial. In addition, a recent psychological examination found him to have an IQ of 85 in his best functioning range and to have problems associated with brain damage. Delma Banks had no prior criminal record when convicted. The jury was apparently not told that the main prosecution witness, also involved in the crime, testified in return for lenient treatment. "
