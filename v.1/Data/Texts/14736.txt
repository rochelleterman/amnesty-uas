 EXTRA 58/93 - Turkey: fear of torture: Metin Turan, Murat Ozdemir | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There are fears that Metin Turan and Murat Ozdemir are being interrogated under torture at the Anti-Terror Branch of Ankara Police Headquarters. Metin Turan, the lead singer of the music group ""Grup Ekin"" was detained at the airport in Antalya on 12 June 1993 when he returned home from a concert tour in Germany. Another member of the group had been detained during a raid by police on the Ekin Arts centre in Ankara in April (see EXTRA 38/93, EUR 44/40/93). Murat Ozdemir, the baglama player of ""Grup Ekin"" was detained on 11 June at Ankara Justice Building, when he went there to claim back items seized during the police raid on the Ekin Arts Centre. Seven people detained during this raid allege that they had been tortured in police custody. "
