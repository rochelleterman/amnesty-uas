 USA (Alabama): Death penalty / Legal concern: Thomas Douglas Arthur (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Thomas Arthur is scheduled for execution on 31 July 2008 in Alabama. The state is pursuing his execution even though his conviction was based mainly on the testimony of an admitted perjurer who had an incentive to lie at his trial. Although DNA evidence exists which Thomas Arthur says could help demonstrate his innocence, the State of Alabama has not granted his request to be allowed to conduct DNA testing of evidence relating to the crime."
