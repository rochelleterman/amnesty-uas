 USA (Texas): Further information on Death Penalty: 250th  Texas execution looms, Richard William Kutzner | Amnesty International 
 The execution of Richard Kutzner, has been stayed. Late on 24 July, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals blocked Kutzner's execution, due on 25 July, to allow consideration of his request to have DNA testing conducted on newly-discovered physical evidence. Mack Oran Hill is now set to become the 250th prisoner put to death in Texas since 1982.
