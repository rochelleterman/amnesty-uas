 The appeal of Iskandar Khudoberganov against his death    sentence and the appeals of Bekzod Kasymbekov, Nosirkhon  Khakimov and their three co-defendants against their      prison sentences were turned down on 28 January 2003 by   the Presidium of Tashkent City Court. The men were        convicted in November at a trial that grossly violated    international human rights standards. They can however,   now appeal their sentences at the Supreme Court of        Uzbekistan.
