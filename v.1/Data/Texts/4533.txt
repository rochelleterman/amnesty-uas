 Colombia: Fear for Safety. | Amnesty International 
 Two members of the Internal Council of the Peace Community of San Jos_ de Apartad—, Wilson David Higuita and Gildardo Tuberquia, were amongst several people recently detained by the Colombian army. During their detention, the two men were reportedly accused of being guerrilla collaborators. Amnesty International is seriously concerned for their safety and for other inhabitants of the community, in the municipality of Apartad—, department of Antioquia, as in the past such accusations have frequently been followed by serious human rights violations committed by army-backed paramilitaries.
