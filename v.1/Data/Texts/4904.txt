 UA 208/94 - Colombia: fear for safety: Isabel Cristina Rincon Bravo | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Isbael Cristina Rincon Bravo is being intimidated and harassed by members of the Colombian armed forces, apparently because she has been helping with investigations into the killing of her husband in which the security forces are implicated. Her husband, Henry Humberto Molina, was killed on 7 September 1992 in what may have been an extrajudicial execution. Currently under investigation for the killing are officials attached to the Cacique Nutibara battalion and police based in the town of El Carmen de Atrato, Choco department."
