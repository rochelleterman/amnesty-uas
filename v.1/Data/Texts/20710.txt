 NA 
 Four and a half years ago, the USA transferred the first ""war on terror"" detainees - hooded and shackled - to its detention facility at Guantánamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. Approximately 750 people have been held at the facility. Today, more than 400 people from over 30 countries remain held without charge or trial in the base."
