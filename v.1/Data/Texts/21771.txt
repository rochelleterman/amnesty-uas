 Bahrain: Eight activists detained in Bahrain | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Eight prominent opposition activists have been detained in Bahrain following the use of grossly excessive force by Bahraini security forces, backed by Saudi Arabian troops, against anti-government protestors. Six people were killed on 16 March 2011 and hundreds injured. Amnesty International believes the eight detainees are prisoners of conscience and is calling for their immediate and unconditional release. They are also at risk of torture."
