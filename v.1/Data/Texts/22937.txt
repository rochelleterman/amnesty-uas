 NA 
 Ramzi Romdhani, a prisoner serving a long sentence at Mornaguia Prison near Tunis, has been denied family visits since 4 February 2010. When he was last able to speak to his relatives, he told them that he was being held in solitary confinement and had been threatened with torture. He has previously reported that he was tortured and otherwise ill-treated on at least three occasions in 2009. He is now at further risk of torture and other ill-treatment. "
