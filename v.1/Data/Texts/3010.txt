 Sudan: Fear of Torture / Forced Relocation / Excessive use of force: 13 women (names unknown), residents of al-Geer camp

 In the early morning of 10 November, Sudanese police carried out the latest in a series of increasingly violent attacks against displaced people held in camps in South Darfur. The attacks appear to be an attempt to forcibly evict people from these camps, a further violation of the rights of those who have already been forced to flee their homes by the conflict in the Darfur region.
