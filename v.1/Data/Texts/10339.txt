 UA 408/92 - Bangladesh: fear of forcible return (refoulement): Burmese Muslim refugees | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Over 150 Burmese Muslims from Rakhine State (Arakan) are reported to have been repatriated against their will from Bangladesh to Myanmar on 25 November 1992. They were among a group of over 900 repatriated that day. Reports indicate that they were coerced into ""volunteering"" to return. Since then, around 2 000 refugees have been repatriated without the involvement of the Office of the UNHCR; over 4 000 more are expected to be repatriated before the end of December. AI fears that many of them will be at risk of serious human rights violations in Myanmar. "
