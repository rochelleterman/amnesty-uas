 Colombia: Further information on apparent extrajudicial execution / fear for safety and new concern: torture: Civilians in Pailitas and other municipalities in Cesar Department | Amnesty International 
 AI continues to be concerned for the safety of the civilian population in the municipality of Pailitas, who face continuing paramilitary threats and attacks. These concerns have been heightened by the torture and killings, on 8 May 1996, of Luis Uribe and Luis Fuentes Marques by a paramilitary group in Pailitas. Reportedly, the two men, drivers of public hire vehicles, were stopped at a checkpoint, beaten with a whip which had a bullet attached to its end, tortured and shot dead by a paramilitary group.
