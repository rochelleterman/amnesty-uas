 Despite the fact that Ukraine, by having joined the Council of Europe, has committed itself to an immediate moratorium on executions, there are fears that the authorities may be continuing to execute prisoners on death row. Sergey Nikolaevich Dragunov was sentenced to death for premeditated murder by the Donetsk Regional Court on 29 March 1995 and may be facing imminent execution."
