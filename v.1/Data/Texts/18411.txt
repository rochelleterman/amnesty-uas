 Saudi Arabia: Incommunicado detention/fear of torture or ill-treatment/medical concern, Dr Sa'id bin Zu'air (m) | Amnesty International 
 Former university professor Dr Sa'id Bin Zu'air, a critic of the government, was arrested in the capital, Riyadh,   on 6 June. He is held incommunicado at an unconfirmed     location and is at risk of torture and other              ill-treatment. He apparently suffers from rheumatism and  low blood pressure, and was reportedly not allowed to     bring his medicine when he was arrested.
