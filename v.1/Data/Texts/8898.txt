"USA (Kentucky): Death penalty / legal concern: Harold McQueen 
 USA (Kentucky): Death penalty / legal concern: Harold McQueen | Amnesty International 
 Harold McQueen, white, is scheduled to be executed on 1 July 1997 in what would be the first execution in Kentucky since 1962. He was sentenced to death for murder in 1981, but there is concern that he was not adequately represented in court, and that no court has considered the mitigating evidence that he suffers from brain damage.
