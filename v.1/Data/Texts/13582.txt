 Former gang member Liu Huan-jong was executed on 23 March 1993. After his execution his heart and corneas were removed, following his reported wish to donate these organs. AI opposes the death penalty in all cases; it is also concerned about the ethical issues surrounding the use of organs from executed prisoners. "
