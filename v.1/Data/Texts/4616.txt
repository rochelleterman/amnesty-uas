 Colombia: Further information on extrajudicial executions / fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Carlos Enrique Maso Vargas was murdered after he was abducted from a bus by paramilitaries who accused him of being a guerrilla. His brother Jhon Fredy Vargas was not taken at the same time because he was accompanied by his five-year-old son.  There are also fears for the safety of Alvaro Gaviria, another displaced person who has also been threatened by paramilitaries.
