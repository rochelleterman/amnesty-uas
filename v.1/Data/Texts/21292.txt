 Hundreds of asylum-seekers and migrants are at imminent risk of forced eviction from encampments near Calais in northern France, after the authorities stated that the area would be cleared by 25 September 2009. If those seeking asylum are forcibly returned, they may risk torture or ill-treatment.  "
