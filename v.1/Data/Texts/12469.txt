 Four more people have been killed by police and at least 50 injured, including 14 policemen, during clashes between police and demonstrators, during a nationwide transport strike called by the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist and Leninist) (CPN-UML) on 19 July 1993. There have also been reports of mass arrests, including 16 members of parliament, who were later released. Police reports have stated that 400 people were arrested, but unofficial sources put the number of arrests nationwide at 4,500. Two members of parliament, Jagrit Bhetwal and Amik Shrechan, and D P Kandel, the Chairman of the Rupendehi District Committee of the Forum for the Protection of Human Rights (FOPHUR) were severely beaten by police on arrest. Amik Shrechan later had to be hospitalised. "
