"Kazakstan: Fear of imminent execution: Oleg Amiranovich Gorozashvili 
 NA 
 Oleg Amiranovich Gorozashvili is facing imminent execution after the Clemency Commission turned down his petition for clemency on 25 December 1996. On 22 January he was being transferred to death row in a prison in Almaty, which has facilities to carry out executions, and his execution is expected to be carried out on 24 January. He was sentenced to death by the East Kazakstan Regional Court for premeditated aggravated murder. There are allegations that after his arrest he was questioned without the presence of a defence lawyer and that he was forced to make a confession.
