 North Korea: Suffering in silence | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 For more than a decade, North Korea has suffered from a ""silent famine"" in which hundreds of thousands are reported to have died of starvation and related illness.  One of the main reasons is that the North Korean          government has imposed severe restrictions on independent monitors, food donors, international governmental         organisations and NGOs."
