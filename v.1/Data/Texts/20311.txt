 Two young men, 22-year-old Silverio Iván Jaimes Filio and 23-year-old Jorge Raúl Jaimes Jiménez were arbitrarily arrested in Morelos state, central Mexico, and tortured by soldiers. They were released a few hours later but were threatened that they would be in danger if they reported the incident. Their lives could be at risk."
