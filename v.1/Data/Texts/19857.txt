 Canada: Further information on Possible Prisoner of Conscience: Jeremy Hinzman (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Jeremy Hinzman and his family have been allowed to stay in Canada until the countryâ€™s Federal Court decides whether or not to review their case. Jeremy Hinzman fled to Canada to avoid being sent to Iraq because of his conscientious objection to the war there. If deported, he risks being court-martialled and jailed for between one and five years. If convicted, Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience."
