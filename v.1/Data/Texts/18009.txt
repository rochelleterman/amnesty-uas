 Kuwait: Fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Seven Filipino nationals, Tiodi Magiliar Tomaro (m), Mary-Jane Vitios (f), Nooriza Talib Ashak (f), Loridos Seri Esper (f), Rosalie Teesor Baklidia (f), Jamie Bernardo (m), and Ojaro Rubia (m), were arrested after the 10 October murder of a Canadian citizen. On 6 November the Kuwaiti Interior Ministry announced that they had ""confessed"" to involvement in the murder. All had allegedly been tortured to force them to confess. Amnesty International is concerned that they may face further torture, and if convicted may face the death penalty on the basis of their ""confessions"".
