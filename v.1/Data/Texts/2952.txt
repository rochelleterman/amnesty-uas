 Sudan: Further information on Fear of torture or ill-treatment/ fear of arbitrary arrest New concerns: Incommunicado detention/ Death in custody | Amnesty International 
 Arrests at Soba Aradi displaced persons camp in Khartoum North are still continuing. There are reportedly more than 100 people still in detention; the vast majority of them are held incommunicado at unknown locations. The fact that a detainee, Abdallah Daw Al-Bait Ahmed died in custody in circumstances where torture may have caused his death, gives added cause for concern.
