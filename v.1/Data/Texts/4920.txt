 Colombia: Fear for safety: Jose Etanislao Amaya Perez | Amnesty International 
 There is grave concern for the safety of Jose Etanislao Amaya Perez, the municipal ombudsman for the district of San Calixto, after he received a death threat on 13 July 1997. It was reportedly signed by a paramilitary group calling itself Autodefensas del Catumbo. The death threat not only raises fears for the safety of Jose Etanislao Amaya, but also for other human rights officers in the region.
