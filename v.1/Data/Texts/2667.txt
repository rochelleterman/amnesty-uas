 Amnesty International is concerned at the arrest of the above named men reportedly between 9 April and 16 April 1993. All those arrested are reportedly members of the Umma Party, whose leader, Sadiq al-Mahdi was arrested and interrogated for 24 hours on 5 April, after calling for a return to a multi-party system in Sudan. Amnesty International is concerned that the above men, arrested on suspicion of engaging in a plot against the government, have been detained solely for engaging in their fundamental right to freedom of expression and association, and considers them to be prisoners of conscience.
