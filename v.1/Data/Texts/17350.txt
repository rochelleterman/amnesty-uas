 Iran: Further information on possible prisoners of conscience / fear of torture or ill-treatment: Up to 17 men | Amnesty International 
 At least 16 of the 17 men arrested on 10 May at a private party in the central Iranian province of Esfahan are known to have been released. All of these men were        required to post bail and will reportedly face a trial    scheduled to take place in June. They were among 87       people reportedly arrested at the party. The 17 men are   believed to have been wearing clothes generally           associated with women at the time they were arrested.     Amnesty International will continue to monitor the        situation closely and take further action if necessary.
