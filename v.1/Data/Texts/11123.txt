 UA 134/94 - India: fear for safety: Kanwar Singh Dhami, Kuldip Kaur, and their six-year-old son | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Kanwar Singh Dhami, his wife Kuldip Kaur, who is five months pregnant, and their son following the refusal of Kanwar Singh Dhami to publicly surrender to the police at a press conference organized by the Director of Police on 29 March in Chandigarh, Punjab. Kanwar Singh Dhami is a leader of the Akal Federation and a well-known advocate of ""Khalistan"". Instead of surrendering he alleged that he and his family had been held in illegal and unacknowledged detention by the police for ten months, during which time they were allegedly tortured. He also alleged that he had been threatened that his family would be killed unless he ""surrendered"" to the police. Both he and his wife are reportedly members of the outlawed ""Panthic Committee""."
