 Haiti: fear for safety / possible “disappearance” | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The life of Wilson Mésilien, the interim coordinator of Fondasyon Trant Septanm (30 September Foundation), may be at risk due to his continued work in defending the rights of the victims of the 1991-1994 military coup. Amnesty International is even more concerned for his safety as the former coordinator of the Fondasyon, Lovinsky Pierre-Antoine, was kidnapped on 12 August 2007 and his whereabouts are still unknown."
