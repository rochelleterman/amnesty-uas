 Iran: Further Information on Health concern/ possible     torture or ill-treatment and new concern: fear for        safety, Siamak Pourzand | Amnesty International 
 Siamak Pourzand was allowed out of Evin prison on leave in November 2002, but rearrested in April 2003. He has been held in solitary confinement since then, in appalling conditions, and is being denied medical treatment for a condition that will leave him confined to a wheelchair if left untreated.
