 Shefki Latifi (aged 56) was detained on 4 July 1995 at Pudujevo station and beaten by police. He died the same day. AI has learned that in July a medical certificate was issued stating that he had died a natural death. The organization, however, has received a copy of a photograph which shows marks of bruising and laceration consistent with allegations that he was beaten. AI calls for an investigation into his ill-treatment and death."
