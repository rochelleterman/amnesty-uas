 UA 402/93 - El Salvador: apparent political killings / fear for safety: Manuel de Jesus Acevedo, Remberto Antonio Lopez | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 8 November Manuel de Jesus Acevedo and Remberto Antonio Lopez were found shot dead in a rubbish dump in Colonia Las Margaritas, Soyapango. Their hands had been tied behind their backs with barbed wire and there were clear signs of torture. Both men had been missing since 6 November. Manuel de Jesus Acevedo was a member of the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN), Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. These killings come days after the murder of four FMLN leaders and members, and there is serious concern for the safety of other FMLN and opposition party members in the run up to the presidential and legislative elections to be held in March 1994."
