 Ukraine: Further information on fear of imminent execution: Vitaly Gumenyuk | Amnesty International 
 Vitaly Gumenyuk's clemency petition has been turned down by the President of Ukraine and he is now in imminent danger of execution. The petition was rejected despite the fact that Ukraine, by having joined the Council of Europe, has committed itself to impose an immediate moratorium on executions and to abolish the death penalty within three years.
