 There are serious fears for the safety of at least ten civilian families living in hamlets in the Magdalena Medio region of Santander Department, following reports of human rights violations perpetrated by the paramilitary group ""Los Masetos"". These abuses were allegedly carried out with the complicity of the Luciano D'Luyer battalion, belonging to the 11 Division of the Colombian army, and include the reported extrajudicial execution of Jose Vicente Rueda and the intimidation of other local people."
