 The municipal authorities of the mainly indigenous Mixteca municipality of Santo Domingo Ixcatl√°n, in Oaxaca state, are preparing to sell off an area of communal land. Local people opposed to the sale have been attacked by armed men working for a local political boss (cacique) closely connected to the municipal authorities: three of them were killed on 30 Apri 2008l; their families are taking advice from a local human rights organisation, whose staff are also in grave danger."
