 AI has received reports that the six men named above have ""disappeared"" after they were detained in the provinces of Diyabakir and Mardin between 22 September and 6 October 1995. The police deny holding any of the men. AI fears that they may be held on suspicion of contravening the Anti-Terror Law or that they are suspected supporters of the PKK (Turkish Workers' Party)."
