 Seventeen Uighurs remain in indefinite military detention in the US Naval Base at Guant√°namo Bay in Cuba more than a month after a federal judge ruled that their continued detention was unlawful and ordered their release into the USA. The government obtained an emergency stay of the order from a higher court, which will now hold oral arguments on the issue on 24 November."
