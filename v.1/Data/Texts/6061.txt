 UA 20/94 - Guatemala: ""disappearance"" / fear for safety: Lorenzo Quiej Pu | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Lorenzo Quiej Pu, following his ""disappearance"" on 12 January 1994 from the First Settlement of Internally Displaced People ""Mario Antonio Diaz"" in zone 1 of Guatemala City. Lorenzo Quiej, a member of the National Council for the Displaced of Guatemala (CONDEG), had been threatened in the past by members of the army following the ""disappearance"" of Luis Miguel Solis Pajarito, a CONDEG leader, on 3 May 1990. His brother, Miguel Quiej Pu, also a member of CONDEG, has presented a formal demand before a judge for the case to be investigated. Lorenzo Quiej is married with five children and works as a travelling shoemaker."
