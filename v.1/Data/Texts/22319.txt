 Esha Momeni was released from Tehran's Evin Prison on 10 November. Her bail of 2000 million rials (approximately US$ 200,000) was met by the deeds to her familyâ€™s apartment. According to the website www.mardomak.org, her father said that she was expected to appear in court on 11 November to face charges of 'acting against state security' and 'propaganda against the system'. He also said that she is not permitted to leave Iran, but hoped that she would be able to return soon to Los Angeles."
