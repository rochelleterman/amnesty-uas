 Nine more Karen refugees have been abducted by DKBO members. On 9 March 1995, some 30 DKBO members seized the nine refugees from a new refugee camp near Mae Ka Khi village. Also on 9 March, DKBO members shot dead two Karen refugees in a robbery attempt near Mae Salit camp. AI has no more news of San Tun or ""Uncle Jolly"", two Karen leaders abducted from Maw La Camp at the beginning of March. AI is gravely concerned for the security of all Myanmar refugees in Thailand."
