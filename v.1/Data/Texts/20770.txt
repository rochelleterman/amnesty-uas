 Two student opposition activists in Bangladesh, Al Mukaddas and Mohammad Waliullah, have been missing since 4 February. Eyewitnesses saw them being detained by Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and the Detective Branch (DB) of the Bangladesh Police in Savar, north of the capital, Dhaka. The RAB have denied holding them, with no credible explanation to counter the eyewitness accounts. The men are at risk of torture and extrajudicial execution."
