 UA 284/93 - Malawi: death penalty: Foster Azele Mlombwa | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Foster Azele Mlombwa could face execution if his appeal to the Traditional Court of Appeal in Lilongwe fails on 25 August 1993. Foster Mlombwa, former Malawi Congress Party (MCP) chairman for Dedza district, was arrested on 10 December 1992 and charged with the murder of a police officer on 9 December. He was reportedly taken to the local police station where he was beaten with an iron bar until he lost consciousness. In April 1993 he was sentenced to death after an unfair trial by the Central Region Traditional Court. Malawi's ""traditional courts"" constitute a separate judicial system parallel to the ordinary courts. Legal representation is not permitted, and the independence of the judges is open to question."
