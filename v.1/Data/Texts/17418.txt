 Iran: Death penalty/ Fear of imminent execution: Behnam Zare' (m)
 | Amnesty International 
 Behnam Zare', aged 18, has been convicted of a murder committed when he was 15 years old, and is now at risk of imminent execution, though Iran is a state party to international treaties including the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which expressly prohibit the execution of child offenders. Behnam Zare' has been detained in Adelabad prison, in the south-western city of Shiraz, since his arrest. His death sentence could be carried out at any time.
