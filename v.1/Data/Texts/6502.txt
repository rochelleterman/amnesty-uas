 Amnesty International has learned that the detention order for the journalists was apparently issued, but was not implemented, as it could not be ratified by the courts. The names of the 11 journalists are also now known: Carmen Aida Ibarra, Haroldo Sanchez, Marta Altolaguirre and Marco Vinicio Mejia (Diario Siglo XXI); Jose Eduardo Zarco Bolanos, Hugo Gordillo, General Secretary of the Social Media Union (Diario Prensa Libre); Hugo Arce, Walter Hermosilla (Diario El Grafico); Ricardo Lopez (Diario La Hora); Rony Ivan Veliz (Reuters correspondent); and Oscar Granados, President of the National Council for the Defence of Journalists "
