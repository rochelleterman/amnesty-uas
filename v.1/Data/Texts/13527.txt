 NA 
 Sinnathambi Meganathan was abducted on 10 November 1993 from a bus in the centre of Colombo by five armed men in civilian dress. He was taken away in a jeep which witnesses have described and which reportedly belongs to the Batticaloa Police. Sinnathambi Meganathan comes from Mandur in Batticaloa District, but now lives at Sravasti in Colombo with Suresh Premachandran, a member of parliament, for whom he works as a bodyguard. Although his case has been raised in parliament and with the Prime Minister and the Defence Secretary, his whereabouts remain unknown."
