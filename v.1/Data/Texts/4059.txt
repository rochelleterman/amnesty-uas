 Chile: Medical Concern | Amnesty International 
 Juan Carlos Huenulao (m), Florencio Jaime Marileo (m) and Juan Patricio Marileo (m), indigenous Mapuches, and Patricia Roxana Troncoso (f), a Mapuche sympathiser, have been on hunger strike for 54 days since 13 March at Temuco prison in the Novena Region of Chile. They were tried and sentenced under anti-terrorism law which the government has reportedly now claimed will no longer be applied against Mapuches. Amnesty International is calling on the authorities to ensure that they receive adequate medical attention.
