 NA 
 On 6 January 1997, Gabi 'Aql Karam was reportedly detained by four officers, allegedly from the Lebanese Intelligence forces, and is now being held at an unknown location. Fears that he may face torture are heightened by the fact that he suffers from a back injury and psychological problems, reportedly as a result of torture in Syria in 1994.
