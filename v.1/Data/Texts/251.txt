					Sergeant René Rukengamangamizi | Amnesty International 
 Two soldiers, Napol_on Manirakiza and Sergeant Ren_       Rukengamangamizi, were executed on 19 October just hours  after they were sentenced to death, in flagrant disregard of    their right to appeal. Amnesty       International  is concerned that other prisoners under     sentence of   death could now face imminent execution.
