 DRC: Extrajudicial executions / Torture and Ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Dozens of detainees may be at imminent risk of extrajudicial execution or torture, following a failed attempt to overthrow the leadership of an armed political group operating in the Ituri province of north-eastern DRC. The detainees are being held incommunicado in metal containers and several have been tortured. At least four people are thought to have already been executed in the wake of the failed coup.
