 Michael Domingues is on death row in Nevada for a crime   committed when he was aged 16. He is appealing against    his death sentence. If the US Supreme Court upholds his   appeal, it could result in the reversal of the death      sentences of the more than 70 child offenders currently   on death row in 16 US states.
