 The six patients named in this document were able to leave Gaza when the Gaza-Egypt border was opened exceptionally on 30 and 31 August 2008. They are now receiving medical treatment abroad. The other critically ill patients have still not been able to leave Gaza and are thus still unable to receive the medical treatment they desperately need."
