 Tunisia: Further information on fear of unfair trial and new concern: prisoner of conscience: Mohamed Kilani | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Mohamed Kilani was tried in Gabes on 15 February 1995 on charges of supporting an unauthorized association (the Parti Communiste des Ouvriers Tunisiens, PCOT) and holding unauthorized meetings. On 22 February he was found guilty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. There are strong reasons to believe that his trial was not conducted in compliance with international fair trial standards. AI considers him to be a prisoner of conscience who should be released immediately and unconditionally."
