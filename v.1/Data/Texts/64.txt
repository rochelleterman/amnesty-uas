 Angola: Further information on forced evictions/use of excessive force | Amnesty International 
 About 600 families were forcibly evicted from their homes in four neighbourhoods of the capital, Luanda, on 13 March. The evictions were carried out violently, without prior consultation, and without due process of law. This is the fourth forcible eviction carried out in the area in recent months, leaving thousands of people homeless and without shelter. Police also arrested two members of SOS-Habitat, including the coordinator, LuÁs Ara£jo, but released them afterwards.
