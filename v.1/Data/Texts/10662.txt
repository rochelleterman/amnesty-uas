"People's Republic of China (PRC): Death penalty 
 People's Republic of China (PRC): Death penalty | Amnesty International 
 Four men, Jin Ruchao, Wang Yushun, Hao Fengqin, and Hu Xiaohong were sentenced to death on 18 April. Amnesty International is concerned that they may have been convicted without full investigation of the crime or fair trial because the authorities were under pressure to solve this high-profile crime quickly.
