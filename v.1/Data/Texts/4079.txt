 Juana Calfunao Paillalef's house was destroyed by fire in an apparent arson attack on 22 July. The Mapuche community leader's house, in the Juan Paillalef indigenous community, was still being rebuilt after it was previously burned down in June 2004. She and her family are in grave danger. This attack may be linked to Juana Calfunao Paillalef's activism in defence of her community in a dispute with local landowners.
