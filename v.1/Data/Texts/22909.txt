 Algeria: Closing update on Stop destroying evidence | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 This action helped to raise awareness and mobilize        international pressure on the removal of human remains    from a mass grave site that was believed to contain       mortal remains of individuals who ""disappeared"" following their abduction by state-armed militias in Algeria. It    also contributed to protecting Algerian human rights      defenders who work on this sensitive issue."
