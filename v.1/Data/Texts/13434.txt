 Amnesty International has received a report that at least 17 of the security forces personnel taken prisoner by the LTTE have recently been seen at a location in the Jaffna Peninsula. It has also been reported that five of those captured had been admitted to a hospital in Jaffna for medical treatment. According to press reports, the LTTE maintain that no security forces personnel were captured alive, and there is continued concern for the safety of the prisoners."
