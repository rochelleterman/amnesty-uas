 The four people named above are reported to have been detained on 1 February 1993 during a police operation in Istanbul. There is particular concern for the safety of Mehmet Aytunc Altay, who has been tortured during previous detentions. He was tried for belonging to the illegal armed opposition group TKP/B but the outcome of the trial is not known. AI fears that the four may be subjected to torture in incommunicado detention. "
