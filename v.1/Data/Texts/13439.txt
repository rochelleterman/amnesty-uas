 Sri Lanka: Further information on incommunicado detention/ fear of torture or ill-treatment/ detention without charge 
 | Amnesty International 
 Journalist Munusamy Parameshawary was released on 22 March following a Supreme Court ruling that there was insufficient evidence against her and she should therefore be released. A number of other journalists are still in custody, as is Dushyantha Basnayake, director of the Sinhalese-language weekly newspaper Mawbima. He has not had access to his lawyer since he was arrested on 26 February. He is in danger of torture or ill-treatment.
