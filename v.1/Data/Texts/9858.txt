 USA (Georgia): Further information on Death penalty / Legal concern: Troy Anthony Davis (m) | Amnesty International 
 On 3 August, the Georgia Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal of Troy Davis, black, aged 38,  whose 17 July      execution was stayed less than 24    hours before it was  due to be carried out.  By four votes to three, the Court granted an extraordinary appeal and   agreed to hear      arguments in his case to consider whether  the new        witness testimony and other evidence discovered   since   his 1991 trial are such that Troy Davis should be         granted a new trial. It will hear the case some time in its November 2007 session.
