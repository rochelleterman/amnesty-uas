 Witnesses interviewed by an Amnesty International delegation which visited Chiapas in January 1994, have alleged that the above named men were detained together with 31 others on 7 January after the army raided the Tzeltal indigenous community of Morelia, Altamirano municipality, state of Chiapas. The three were reportedly tortured inside the local church before being taken away in a military ambulance. They have not been seen since. The authorities have denied holding them, and there is grave concern for their safety. The 31 others detained allegedly suffered beatings, kicking and burns during their detention. Some have been released, although the exact figure is unknown. The others remain in Cerro Hueco prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez."
