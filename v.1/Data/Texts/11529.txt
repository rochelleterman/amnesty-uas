 The six East Timorese prisoners of conscience earlier reported as ""disappeared"" are now understood to be in custody in the city of Semarang, Central Java. The six had managed a small protest during a visit by foreign journalists in April 1994 and it seems likely that they were moved to avoid further embarassment to the authorities during future official visits to East Timor."
