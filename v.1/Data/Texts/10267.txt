 Ly Chandara, Ly Thara, Nguyen Phong Seun: AI has learned today that Nguyen Phong Seun has been released from an Interrogation Centre in Ho Chi Minh City and has returned to Phnom Penh. His release was apparently permitted because of a very serious illness, and he will not face charges in Viet Nam. The other two men remain in detention but AI has received information indicating that they might be released.
