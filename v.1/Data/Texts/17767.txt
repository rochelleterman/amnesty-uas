 Israel: Legal concern/ incommunicado detention: Detainees suspected of ""security"" offences

 | Amnesty International 
 The Israeli government is seeking to enact a new law which would empower the security forces to detain anyone suspected of ""security"" offences incommunicado for up to 30 days after arrest. Amnesty International is concerned that detainees cut off from the outside world for this length of time are at much greater risk of being tortured or ill-treated. The Knesset (parliament) will vote on the law on 20 June.
