 Libya: Incommunicado detention/ health concern | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the health and safety of former prisoner of conscience Fathi al-Jahmi. There are also concerns for the safety of his wife, Fawzia 'Abdullah Gogha, and their eldest son, Muhammad Fathi al-Jahmi who were reportedly detained along with him on 26 March. Amnesty International received information that Fathi al-Jahmi is ill and requires medical treatment, which it appears he is being denied.
