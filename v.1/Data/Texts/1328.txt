 Prisoner of conscience Vera Chirwa was released from prison on 24 January 1993 after 12 years in prison. She was pardoned by President Banda on humanitarian grounds, following international appeals on her behalf. Her husband, Orton Chirwa, died in detention in October 1992. The schoolboy and school receptionist arrested on 29 October 1992 in connection with the arrest of Reverend Aaron Longwe, a leading member of the opposition group AFORD, are believed to have been released. The charge of incitement against Reverend Longwe has not yet proceeded to trial. "
