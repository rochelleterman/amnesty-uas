 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Gurjit Singh, aged 21, the son of Randhir Singh of Mohi village, Ludhiana district. On 8 May 1993 he was picked up by five plainclothed policemen in a van without plates. The police deny any knowledge of his arrest, although one officer, on 11 May 1993, unofficially told Gurjit Singh's family that Gurjit Singh was in their custody. He gave no further information about why or where he is being held. "
