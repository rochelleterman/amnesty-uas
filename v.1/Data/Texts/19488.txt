 The Federal High Court in Addis Ababa has yet again postponed delivering a verdict against prisoners of conscience Daniel Bekele and Netsanet Demissie, who face possible life sentences on political charges. The verdict is now due to be given on 24 December 2007. Both men have already been held in prison for more than two years, as bail has continually been refused."
