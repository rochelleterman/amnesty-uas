 UA 343/92 - Turkey: fear of ""disappearance"" / torture: Ayhan Efeoglu | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about the ""disappearance"" of Ayhan Efeoglu, a 25-year-old student and political activist who has been detained previously on numerous occasions. He has allegedly been held in unacknowledged police detention since 6 October 1992. Another political detainee held at the Anti-Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters since the end of September has testified that police showed him a photograph of Ayhan Efeoglu during interrogation and told him that he had been detained and had been ""broken"". Ayhan Efeoglu's father and lawyers have filed a law suit against the Anti- Terror Branch of Istanbul Police. "
