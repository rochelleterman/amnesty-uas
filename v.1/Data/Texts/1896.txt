 Rwanda: Fear for safety / ill-treatment / extrajudicial / unlawful arrest | Amnesty International 
 There are fears for the safety of Epiphanie Uwitakiye,    Suzanne Mukamusoni and her husband, Blaise Barankoreho    following the death of F?licien Gasana (husband of        Epiphanie Uwitakiye) apparently as a result of injuries   inflicted in detention. All three are detained in the     capital, Kigali. Their detention is thought to be related to their attempts to claim back their property, which had been occupied.
