 Joseph Faulder, a Canadian national, has had his execution date postponed to 23 October 1992. This is his fifth execution date this year. Joseph Faulder, white, aged 54, was convicted of the murder of a white woman in 1975. The conviction was overturned on appeal but in 1981 he was again convicted and sentenced to death. Three psychiatrists examined him for the prosecution at his second trial: they found that he was incapable of rehabilitation and should be sentenced to death. His attorneys have recently learned that he was diagnosed at age nine as brain damaged; they also learned that he started drinking alcohol at age 14 and became an alcoholic. This evidence was not presented at his trial. It is also alleged that his accomplice and a key witness were paid to testify against him. "
