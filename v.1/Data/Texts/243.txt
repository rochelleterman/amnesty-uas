 Burundi: Further information on fear of further extrajudicial executions: civilian population of suburb of Kamenge | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is continued concern at reports of killings of civilians by the Burundi army in the Kamenge suburb of Bujumbura. Several clashes between the Burundi armed forces and Hutu militia were reported in mid-July and early August. In early July Hutu civilians were allowed to return to Kamenge on condition that they obtained residence permits from military authorities. The suburb continues to be cordoned off and even governmental and judicial officials are not allowed access. It is therefore impossible to establish how many unarmed civilians have been victims of extrajudicial execution. On 7 June Pamphile Simbizi, a Hutu journalist with Burundi government-owned radio was killed by a soldier in Gasenyi. No action is known to have been taken by the authorities."
