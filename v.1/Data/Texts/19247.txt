 Tunisia: Fear of torture / legal concern: Bachir Abid, Ali Jallouli, Abdel Moumen Belanes and other students | Amnesty International

 The three men named above were arrested on 30 November 1995 together with scores of other students following peaceful strikes at Tunisian universities. It is not known how many are still held. The three are reportedly being held incommunicado in the Ministry of the Interior in Tunis and there are fears they may suffer torture or ill-treatment. They all face sentences passed in absentia on charges of their alleged association with the unauthorized Parti Communiste des Ouvriers Tunisiens, PCOT. If they are detained on account of these sentences, Amnesty International would consider them to be prisoners of conscience."
