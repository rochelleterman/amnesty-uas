 There has been no news of the whereabouts of Rabah Kadri, an Algerian national who was deported from France on 15 April 2008, since he arrived in the port of Algiers the following day. He may be detained by or have been transferred to officers of the Department for Information and Security (Département du renseignement et de la sécurité, DRS), in which case he would be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment."
