 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of an alleged guerrilla leader, known as ""Dumar"", from the armed opposition group Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, Fuerzas Armadas Revolcionaries Colombianas (FARC), who was captured by the armed forces at the beginning of July 1993 in Rio Viejo, Bolivar department. Reports state that he has not yet been brought before a judge or charged with a recognizable criminal offence, and that he has been publicly paraded and subjected to torture and ill-treatment by his captors, including being gagged with a rope, lacerated and beaten with a stick.
