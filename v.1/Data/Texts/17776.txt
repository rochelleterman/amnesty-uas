 Israel/OT: Further information on torture/ill-treatment/prisoner of conscience, 'Abed      al-Rahman al-Ahmar
 | Amnesty International 
 ?Abed al-Rahman al-Ahmar is being tortured or ill-treated in custody at the Moskobiyya Detention Centre in Jerusalem. At an 11 June hearing, judges at the Israeli High Court of Justice refused to examine the marks of shackles on his wrists, and prison doctors apparently agreed the marks were made by shackles but did not testify. The judges rejected a petition filed by two human rights groups calling for the torture to stop.
