 USA: Further information on: Legal concern/health concern/torture: Unknown number of GuantÃ¡namo detainees | Amnesty International 
 The US military has reportedly made a number of concessions to some of the detainees at Guantænamo Bay following the hunger strike at the prison camp, which is now known to have ended by 1 August. Detainees had gone on hunger strike to protest at conditions in the camp, their indefinite detention without charge or trial, the lack of clean drinking water, poor quality food and disparities in the way detainees in different parts of the detention facility were treated. Several of the hunger-strikers had to be hospitalised and given fluids intravenously.
