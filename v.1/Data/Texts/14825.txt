 NA 
 Eren Keskin, Secretary of the Istanbul Human Rights Association, was arrested on 1 June 1995. She has been taken to police headquarters in the Gayrettepe district of Istanbul. Eren Keskin has been repeatedly targetted because of her human rights work. AI fears that this re-arrest puts her at risk of torture. AI considers her to be a prisoner of conscience who should be released immediately and unconditionally."
