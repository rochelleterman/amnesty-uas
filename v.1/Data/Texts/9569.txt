 USA: Fear of torture and ill-treatment / Fear of ""disappearance"" | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International fears that any detainees held incommunicado in the US military's Forward Operating Bases in Afghanistan or in the secret custody of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in that country are at particular risk of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It is not known how many detainees are in these facilities. What is known is that hundreds of detainees are held in the USA's two main airbases, Bagram and Kandahar, outside of any legal framework.
