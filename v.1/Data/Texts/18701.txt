 Syria: Further information on Incommunicado detention/fear of torture/""disappearance""/medical concern/prisoner of conscience/Unfair trial, Aktham Nu'aysa | Amnesty International 
 Aktham Nu'aysa was released on bail on 16 August. His trial before the Supreme State Security Court (SSSC) is due to continue on 24 October. Amnesty International considers the court's procedures to be grossly unfair: Aktham Nu'aysa is facing a sentence of up to 15 years' imprisonment on charges that appear to arise solely from his legitimate work in defence of human rights.
