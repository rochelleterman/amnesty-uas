 'Abd al-Rahman Hassan Khafi, an Iraqi national sentenced to death by Kuwait's State Security Court last year, was executed on 5 May 1993. According to available information, this was the first recorded judicial execution to have been carried out in Kuwait since 1989. Since April 1992, seven death sentences, including that of 'Abd al-Rahman Khafi, have been passed, one of them in absentia. The five other death sentences passed on those named above, are currently before the Court of Cassation or awaiting ratification by the Amir. 'Abd al-Rahman Khafi was arrested following the withdrawal of Iraq forces from Kuwait in February 1991, and was among some 150 defendants brought to trial on charges of ""collaboration"". "
