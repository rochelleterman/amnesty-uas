 Mao Hengfeng was released on 12 September, on completion of her 18-month term of ""Re-education through labour"". However, she defied orders to stop protesting about this and other violations of her rights, and so the security forces have harassed and beaten both her and her husband, Wu Xuewei. Both are at risk of arbitrary detention and torture.
