 In the last two weeks, scores of individuals, mainly from Darfur, have been arrested in the capital, Khartoum. Many of those arrested are reported to be held incommunicado in national security detention facilities in the capital or at unknown locations. All the detainees are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment, and may even be killed or subjected to enforced disappearance by the authorities. "
