 The first seven of the above people, all civilians, were reportedly killed on 1 January 1994 by government troops in Day district, reportedly in reprisal for casualties inflicted by rebels. Four other civilians, including Mohamed Adoyta Ewad, were reportedly executed by soldiers on 8 January. There are fears for the safety of the seven detainees listed above, who were among several others arrested in Day district, and who are still detained on suspicion of supporting the FRUD (Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy) rebels. There are fears that they have been and continue to be tortured in custody. One detainee, Ali Daoud Ali, died in custody, after being arrested in Garassou village in mid-December 1993, allegedly as a result of torture."
