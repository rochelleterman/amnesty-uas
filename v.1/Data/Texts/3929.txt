 Brazil: Further information on fear for safety / possible extrajudicial execution | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has received news that three men have been arrested in connection with the murder of Carlos Cezar Borges Andrade Fernandes, aged 10, who was killed in January 1998. The men claim they were paid to do so by the local military policeman. They say that the killing was a ""punishment"" to the boy's mother, Serenita Andrade Fernades, for publicly expressing her suspicion that the policeman had been involved in the murder of her brother.
