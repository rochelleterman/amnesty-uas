 Iran: Mass trial of protesters undermining justice | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A mass trial of more than 100 people accused of organizing protests against the widely-disputed official result of the 12 June presidential election began before the Revolutionary Court in Tehran on 1 August. Trials before this court are unfair and if convicted the defendants face harsh penalties. Many are believed to be prisoners of conscience and reports suggest some may have been tortured or otherwise ill-treated in pre-trial detention. "
