 USA: Legal concern/Impunity    UN Security Council: No double standards on  international justice | Amnesty International 
 The USA vetoed the extension of the UN Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) at the UN Security Council on 30 June. This was because the USA did not get immunity for its personnel from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The USA did however agree to a 72-hour extension of the mission to allow for further discussion.
