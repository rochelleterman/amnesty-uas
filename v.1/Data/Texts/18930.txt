 Algeria: Further information on Possible ""disappearance""/Secret detention/Fear   of torture or ill-treatment: Mohammed Yahi | Amnesty International 
 Mohammed Yahi has been remanded in custody at the military prison in Blida. His brother was able to visit him last week. It is not known what charges were brought against him or why he was presented to a military court instead of a civil court. Algerian law generally does not provide for civilians to be brought before a military court. His family has engaged a lawyer.
