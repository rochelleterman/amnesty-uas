 Uzbekistan: Torture/health concern/possible prisoner of conscience: Ikhtior Khamroev [m] | Amnesty International 
 Ikhtior Khamroev, who has been in jail since September 2006, was reportedly severely beaten on 29 November 2007. Sources inside the prison have told his father that Ikhtior had also received stab wounds to the abdomen, but was locked in a punishment cell rather than taken to hospital. He is believed to have been detained because of the activities of his father, a prominent human rights defender, and may have been beaten to punish his father for his recent anti-government statements.
