 Algeria: Secret detention/fear of torture: Abdelmajid Touati (m) | Amnesty International 
 Reportedly, Abdelmajid Touati has not been seen or heard of since he was last seen in Algiers, in mid-March. His family has not had any news of him for over three months. Amnesty International fears that he is being held in barracks of a military intelligence agency, the Department for Information and Security. He does not appear so far to have been brought before the judicial authorities. Amnesty International believes that he is being held illegally and arbitrarily and that he is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.
