 China: Medical action: Ill-health and ill treatment of Gong Shengliang | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International (AI) is seriously concerned for the life and well being of Gong Shengliang, a Protestant pastor and leader of the banned ""Huanan (South China) Church"", who is imprisoned in Hongshan prison, Hubei Province. Gong Shengliang's latest health setbacks are compounded by the continual ill-treatment he has received since his imprisonment in 2001."
