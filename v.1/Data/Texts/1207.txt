 Kenya: Legal concern / potential prisoners of conscience / fear of torture or ill-treatment: Juma Kiplenge | Amnesty International 
 Juma Kiplenge and 13 others, currently on bail while being tried for  incitement to violence and unlawful assembly, which carries a prison sentence of five years, may be convicted after an unfair trial.  Prison conditions in Kenya are harsh and in many places amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  Torture and ill-treatment are routine.
