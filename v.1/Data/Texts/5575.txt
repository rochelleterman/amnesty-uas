 NA 
 Three political prisoners, one of them a prisoners of conscience, are reported to be in poor health as a result of being on hunger-strike. Luis Alberto Pita Santos, president of the unofficial Asociacion Defensora de los Derechos Politicos, and Arturo Suarez Ramos, serving 30 years for attempted hijacking, went on hunger-strike, probably in protest at being moved to Boniato Prison, almost 1000 km from their families. Both were reportedly beaten by prison guards because of their protest. Jorge Kerr, apparently convicted of sabotage, has reportedly been on several hunger- strikes in Pinar del Rio Provincial Prison in an attempt to be transferred back to prison in Havana. It is not clear what, if any, medical attention the prisoners have received. "
