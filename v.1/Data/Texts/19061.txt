 UA 260/93 - Tunisia: fear of torture: Tawfik Rajhi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Tawfik Rajhi, a 32-year-old academic, was arrested on 26 July 1993 and continues to be held in incommunicado detention. Despite repeated inquiries with different authorities, his family have been unable to obtain any information as to his whereabouts or legal status. He had returned to Tunisia for a visit on 22 July from France where he has been living for the past 10 years. There is concern that he may be subject to torture or ill- treatment in prolonged garde a vue detention "
