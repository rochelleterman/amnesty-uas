 AI has received reports that Javad Rouhani was permitted to meet a member of his family on 19 September. He is said to have looked thin and tired. It is reported that he has been sentenced to one year's imprisonment. AI has been unable to ascertain the date of his trial, the nature of the charges against him or information on his place of detention. The fate of at least 25 others arrested in connection with the case remains unknown to AI and it is feared that they may be held in incommunicado detention."
