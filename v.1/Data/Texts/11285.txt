 A habeas corpus petition for Jaspal Singh was heard in the Punjab and Haryana High Court on 1 September 1993. He was not presented in court on this date. The petition will next be heard on 9 September. The government is required to present him on that day if he is in their custody, which it continues to deny. However, witnesses have reported that he was taken away by the Punjab or Chandigarh police on 16 August 1993. "
