 Amnesty International is concerned about Amarjit Singh Bittu (son of Haviladar Jagir Singh), a member of the Border Security Force. He was reportedly taken away from his village in Amritsar district by an inspector of the Criminal Intelligence Agency on 20 September 1992. His detention has not been acknowledged by the security forces and it is feared that he is at risk of being tortured or killed. "
