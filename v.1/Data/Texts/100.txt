 UA 349/92 - Angola: legal concern / fear of ill-treatment: Godfrey Absalom Nangonya | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Godfrey Absalom Nangonya, aged 61, was reportedly arrested at his home in Luanda on 1 November, after the outbreak of fighting between government forces and UNITA. He is believed to be imprisoned solely on account of his sympathy with UNITA: he was detained from 1976-1981 for the same reason. He is reportedly being held incommunicado at the high security Prisao da Estrada de Catete. Godfrey Absalom Nangonya is a prominent member of the Angolan Civic Association, and shared responsibility for the organization's human rights program. In this capacity he has made appeals to UNITA about prisoners held by them. "
