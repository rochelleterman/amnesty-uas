 Saudi Arabia: Death Penalty: Muhammad Basheer al-Ramaly (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A court in the northern city of Hail has sentenced a man to death by beheading. He is in imminent danger of execution. Muhammad Basheer al-Ramaly was convicted by the General Court in Hail of the kidnapping and rape of four people which took place in February 2009. His sentence is now before the Court of Cassation for review. Very little is known about his trial, but death sentences are invariably imposed and carried out after unfair trials carried out in secret. "
