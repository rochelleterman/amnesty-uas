 Libya: Swiss national arbitrarily detained in Libya  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Max Goeldi, a Swiss man, is serving a four-month prison sentence in Libya after being convicted of immigration-related offences. Amnesty International believes that the charges were politically motivated and that he is a victim of a diplomatic dispute between Libya and Switzerland, and is appealing to Libyan leader Colonel Muâ€™ammar al-Gaddafi to order his immediate and unconditional release."
