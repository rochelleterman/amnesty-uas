 The authorities have brought serious criminal charges, reportedly including ""terrorism"", against 138 detainees held in a federal prison in Nayarit state. They were arrested during the 25 November demonstrations in Oaxaca. In many cases, those arrested were reportedly not involved in the protests or violence, but still face serious charges. Many detainees have reported being tortured or otherwise ill-treated as well as being denied adequate access to lawyers, family and medical attention. More than 200 people, three of whom are under 18, are reportedly in custody in Oaxaca state prisons and federal prisons as a result of the political conflict in Oaxaca.
