 Iran: Death penalty/Torture: Davoud Abdollahi Moghadam (m) 

 | Amnesty International 
 Colonel Davoud Abdollahi Moghadam, aged 40, army colonel,  was sentenced to death by a military court in February 2007, and is now facing execution. The charges against him are reported to have been politically motivated, and the court proceedings appear to have fallen short of international fair trial standards.
