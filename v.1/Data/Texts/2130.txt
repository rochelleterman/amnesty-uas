 Siza Rani, chairperson of the Sharpeville town branch of the ANC, continues to be harassed by the South African Police. On 27 January 1993 he was reportedly assaulted by members of the Internal Stability Unit of the police and is now in hiding, in fear of his life. His wife and child have had to move away from Sharpeville. Charges made by Siza Rani against police officers allegedly involved in incidents of intimidation more than a year ago have not resulted in any action against those responsible. "
