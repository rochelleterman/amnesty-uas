He and the other student activists named in this action are now all free on bail, awaiting trial on charges of ""establishing and membership of illegal groups in order to disrupt national security"" and ""propaganda against the state"". Their trial will begin on 17 January 2009 at the Revolutionary Court in Tabriz. "
