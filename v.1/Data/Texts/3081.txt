 Togo: Further information on Fear of torture/Prisoner of Conscience, Marc Palanga. | Amnesty International 
 On 26 February, a member the Union of Forces for Change, Mazama Katassa, was arrested in Sotouboua, central Togo. He was transferred on 1 March to Kara Gendarmerie (paramilitary police station) in northern Togo, where he is being held incommunicado detention. There are concerns for his safety as UFC members, including Marc Palanga, have recently been tortured and ill-treated by Togolese military personnel, following their arrest. Amnesty International believes him to be a prisoner of conscience.
