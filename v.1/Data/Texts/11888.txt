 Indonesia (East Timor): Further information on fear for safety: The population   of East Timor 
 | Amnesty International 
 Since the launch of this action, the security situation   in East Timor has improved, notably since the arrival of  the multinational force (INTERFET) and the withdrawal of  the Indonesian National Army (TNI) and many of the        militia groups. Amnesty International is still concerned  about the security of the Timorese people, particularly   East Timorese refugees in West Timor and other parts of   Indonesia.
