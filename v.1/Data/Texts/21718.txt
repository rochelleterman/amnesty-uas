 Slovak Republic: Medical action - Allegations of illegal sterilization of Romani women | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned about allegations of   illegal, including forced, sterilization of Romani women  in Slovakia. The organization is particularly concerned   that in spite of its repeated appeals the investigation   into these allegations is not being conducted             independently, thoroughly and impartially as required by  international law."
