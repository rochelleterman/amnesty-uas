 Spain: Torture / fear for safety / medical concern: Fernando Elejalde Tapia | Amnesty International 
 On 11 March 1997 Fernando Elejalde Tapia, a member of the armed Basque group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), was arrested for the murder of a prison psychologist. He was held by police under  anti-terrorist legislation which allows for extended incommunicado detention for up to five days. On 13 March the police took him to hospital, where it was noted that he had extensive injuries, including a fractured ear drum, four broken vertebrae in his back, bruising all over his body, a kidney malfunction, and he was in a state of semi-consciousness. There is concern that these injuries were the result of torture during interrogation, and Amnesty International is calling for a full investigation. There is further concern that he may be subjected to further ill-treatment once he is released from hospital and returned to police custody.
