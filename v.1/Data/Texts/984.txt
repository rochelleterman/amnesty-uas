 AI is concerned about the detention without charge or trial of opposition leader Johnny Hansen, three wives and one brother of former political detainee Alhaji Tahiru Bambali Damba and eight soldiers. They are apparently suspected of involvement in bomb attacks in Accra and Tema in November 1992. There are reports that Alhaji Tahiru Bambali Damba has himself been arrested. The detainees are believed to be held incommunicado at the headquarters of the Bureau of National Investigation in Accra. Johnny Hansen reportedly requires medication for a blood pressure problem. "
