 The Saudi Arabian government has stayed the execution of an Iraqi man, Mohammad Abdul Amir, to allow his family to negotiate his fate with relatives of the man he allegedly murdered. However, it is unclear how long the execution has been stayed for, and he could be executed at any time if the negotiations break down. "
