 UA 44/93 - Turkey: ""disappearance"" / fear of extrajudicial killing: Metin Can, Dr Hasan Kaya | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Metin Can, a lawyer and chairman of the Human Rights Association in Elazig and Dr Hasan Kaya, a medical doctor, have not been seen since being called from the home of Metin Can on 21 February 1993. On 22 February an unknown person telephoned the home of Metin Can, saying that the two men had been killed. Their car was found in Elazig the next day. On 23 February a relative was telephoned by someone claiming to represent the PKK, claiming to hold Metin Can. However, his family have received no confirmation that he is being held by the PKK and believe that the telephone call may be an attempt to create confusion. There are grave fears for the safety of the two men. "
