 The Ugandan Parliament is preparing to debate a bill which entrenches discrimination and hatred against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. The bill, known as the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, appeared on the Parliamentary Order of Business on 21 November, and could be scheduled for debate at any time. There are fears that the bill might be passed within days of the debate."
