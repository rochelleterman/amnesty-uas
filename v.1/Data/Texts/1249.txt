 Kenya: Further information on arbitrary arrest / fear of ill-treatment / fear of refoulement | Amnesty International 
 Over 600 foreign nationals living in Kenya, including many Rwandese and Burundian nationals have been arrested since 18 July 1997. Many have been released. However reports that many have been told to leave Kenya within a week have heightened concern for their safety as many of them would be at serious risk of human rights violations if returned to their home countries.
