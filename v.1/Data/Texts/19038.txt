 Tunisia:  Secret detention/fear of torture: Houssine Tarkhani (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Tunisian asylum-seeker Houssine Tarkhani was forcibly returned from France on 3 June, and reportedly detained on arrival. He is now in secret detention: the authorities have provided no information to his lawyer and family when they have made enquiries. Amnesty International fears he may be held at the State Security Department of the Ministry of Interior in Tunis, where he would be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.
