 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Gulgeldy Annaniyazov, who is in the second year of a 15-year prison sentence imposed after he was involved in an anti-government demonstration on 12 July 1995. There are reports that he is being held at the maximum security prison in Ashgabat, alongside violent criminals, deliberately to put him at risk of physical assault. Amnesty International is also asking for clarification of the charges made against him.
