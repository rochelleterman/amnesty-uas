 Sri Lanka: Fear of ""disappearance"" | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of      Seenithamby Sathasivam, Somanathan Panchchadcharam and S. Velautham. The men, reportedly arrested on 8 October      1999, have since    ""disappeared"". Witnesses report that  they were handed     over to security forces' personnel,  possibly the army,    but the army denies they are in     their custody.
