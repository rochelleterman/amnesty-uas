 Mexico: Further information on fear for safety / fear of ill-treatment / arbitrary detention / Fear of unfair trial & New concern: Possible prisoner of conscience | Amnesty International 
 On 21 February, Diego Arcos Meneses was committed for trial on the basis of reportedly unfair investigation and trial procedures. He now faces being held in custody for a year or more, while his trial takes place. Amnesty International fears he may have been subjected to an unfair process because of his role as an indigenous community leader, catechist (religious instructor) and health promoter.
