 UA 101/94 - Honduras: fear for safety: Jorge Alberto Sierra Moncada | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Jorge Alberto Sierra Moncada, a leading member of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights in Honduras (CODEH), after he was threatened by an armed man in a bar on 4 March 1994. Subsequent attempts to register this incident with the security forces were made difficult. The facts were finally presented to the Third District Court by CODEH on 11 March. Afterwards several officials allegedly commented that the victim himself was to blame because of his activities, and they implied that the incident was not serious."
