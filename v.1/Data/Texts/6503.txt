 There is concern for the safety of Rene Cabrera Estrada, Finance Secretary of the Union of Workers at the Central Bottling Company (STECSA), who is in a critical condition after being stabbed repeatedly by two unidentified men in Guatemala City on 31 August 1994. He was attacked after taking part in a demonstration in Guatemala City called to protest against the actions of police who on 24 August 1994 forcibly evicted peasants occupying the Hacienda San Juan del Horizonte, Coatepeque province, Quetzaltenango department. According to reports police opened fire on the peasants, killing Efrain Recinos Gomez and Basilio Guzman Juarez, and wounding several others. Over 40 people were detained and later conditionally released. Shortly afterwards, however, the tortured body of Diego Orozco, a trade union leader from the Hacienda, was found 60 kilometres away."
