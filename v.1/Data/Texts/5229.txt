 UA 349/94 - Colombia: fear for safety / death threats: Francisco Ramirez Cuellar | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There are increasing fears that Francisco Ramirez Cuellar, a trade union leader, may be killed or ""disappeared"". Since July 1993, three attempts have been made on his life, and he has been subjected to repeated death threats. These threats began after he had made official complaints against a Colombian senator for her alleged illegal involvement in the state owned company Mineralco SA, in Bogota."
