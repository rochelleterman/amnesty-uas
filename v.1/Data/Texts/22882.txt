 United Arab Emirates (UAE): Fear of unfair trial: Naji Jawdat Hamdan (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Naji Jawdat Hamdan, a US citizen of Lebanese origin, has been charged with terrorism-related offences and is likely to face trial within days, apparently on the basis of a statement he signed after being tortured. Amnesty International fears that he is at risk of being sentenced to death without the possibility of an appeal."
