 Saudi Arabia: Saudi professor detained incommunicado: Dr Mohammed ‘Abdullah al-‘Abdulkareem | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A law professor has been detained incommunicado since 5 December in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, putting him at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Amnesty International is concerned that he may be held solely for the peaceful expression of his right to freedom of expression and therefore be a prisoner of conscience."
