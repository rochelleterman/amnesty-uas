 Turkmenistan: Further information on fair trial concern / fear of death penalty | Amnesty International 
 The trial against Mukhametkuli Aymuradov and Khoshali Garayev is now due to take place on 7 December 1998 at the Supreme Court of Turkmenistan.  Although Amnesty International welcomes the move to try the men in court (it was originally to take place in the prison), it is still expected to be a closed trial and the organization remains concerned  that they will not receive a fair hearing and may be sentenced to death as a result.
