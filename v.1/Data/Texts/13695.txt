 Thailand: Further information on Fear of forcible return: At least 231 ethnic Hmong Laotian refugees | Amnesty International 
 The group of at least 231 ethnic Hmong Laotian refugees, including women and children have reportedly been moved to police detention facilities across the province of Phetchabun and possibly also neighbouring provinces. This is due to overcrowding and a lack of food at Khao Kho district jail, which remains over-crowded. Amnesty International is concerned for their health.
