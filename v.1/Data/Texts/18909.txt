 Algeria: Further information on possible 'disappearance'/Incommunicado Detention/Fear of torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Fateh Ladada and Abdelkrim Khider were reportedly tortured while they were held in secret detention. They have apparently been charged with having links with armed groups. Their families have now been told where they are held, and allowed to visit them in prison, but Amnesty International is concerned that they are still at risk of torture or ill-treatment.
