 NA 
 There are continuing reports of ill-treatment, intimidation, and possible extrajudicial executions being carried out by Croatian soldiers, police and armed civilians against ethnic Serbs remaining in parts of Croatia recently retaken by Croatian forces. The Croatian army is continuing to impose restrictions on the movement of United Nations personnel and other international agencies involved with the monitoring of human rights in the area, fuelling fears for the safety of the ethnic Serbs."
