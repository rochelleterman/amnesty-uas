 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the safety of Afro-descendant inhabitants in the Cacarica River Basin, RÁosucio Municipality, department of Choc¢ after receiving information that army-backed paramilitaries have threatened to enter their communities. In recent years paramilitary forces operating with the support of the security forces have been responsible for serious human rights violations against members of these communities.
