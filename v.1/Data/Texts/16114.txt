 Political prisoner Adzhik Aliyev was not executed on 18 October as had been feared. However he remains under threat of execution. There is further concern at allegations that he did not receive a fair trial. Reportedly the main evidence against him was a confession which his lawyers allege he made under duress. It is also reported that witnesses at the trial failed to place him at the scene of crimes for which he was eventually convicted. Furthermore for about four months of his pre-trial detention he was not represented by a lawyer."
