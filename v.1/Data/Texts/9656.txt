 USA (Indiana): Death penalty / Legal concern, Darnell     Williams (m), black, aged 37

 | Amnesty International 
 Darnell Williams is due to be executed in Indiana on 9 July. He was sentenced to death in 1987 for a double murder committed in 1986. In the light of developments since the trial, the trial prosecutor who sought the death penalty, a law enforcement officer who investigated the case, at least three jurors who voted for the death penalty, and the post-conviction judge who rejected Williams' post-conviction challenges to his death sentence, are urging the governor and the courts to stop the execution.
