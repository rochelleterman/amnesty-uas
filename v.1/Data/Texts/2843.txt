 Human rights defender Dr Mudawi Ibrahim Adam (m), Chair of the Sudan Development Organisation (SUDO) has ended his hunger strike after the Sudanese authorities gave him access to his family and to medical treatment. He is in hospital in the capital Khartoum. He is apparently not being guarded in hospital, and has been permitted to have visitors, including leading UN personnel based in Khartoum. There is still no news about the whereabouts or condition of Salah Mohamed Abdelrahman, who was arrested with Dr Mudawi Ibrahim Adam on 24 January 2005.
