"India: Bonded labourers in Punjab and their relatives members of Volunteers for Social Justice 
 India: Bonded labourers in Punjab and their relatives members of Volunteers for Social Justice | Amnesty International 
 Landlords in Punjab have attempted to abduct bonded       labourers (who work unwaged to pay off loans from the     landllords) from the office of an organisation            campaigning for their rights. Bonded labour is illegal in India, but the law is widely flouted.
