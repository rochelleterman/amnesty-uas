 At least one hundred people killed, including:Mba?na?beye Gaston, Peurbo Michel, Djemadje R?n? Paul, Begoto Paul, Beka?n Joseph, Bemadji Cheflengar, Mba?yom Fran?ois, Mba?ndoul, Reoudoum Isaac and Mba?kounda Ozias: At least 100 people, mainly unarmed civilians, have reportedly been killed by Chadian security forces in the two Logone regions of southern Chad since the beginning of March 1998. The killings appear to be in response to attacks by the Forces arm?es pour la R?publique f?d?rale (FARF), Armed Forces for the Federal Republic, an armed opposition group. AI fears that many more civilians may soon be killed by the security forces and by the FARF.
