 Sudan: Further information on Incommunicado detention/ fear of torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 All those arrested in connection with opposition to the Kajbar Dam have now been released, except for Dr Mohamed Jalal Ahmed Hashim. They were reportedly released after signing a promise not to engage in political activity against the Kajbar Dam. Some of the released detainees said that, though they were not physically ill-treated, there was some psychological ill-treatment, for instance by national security personnel discussing torturing them in their hearing.
