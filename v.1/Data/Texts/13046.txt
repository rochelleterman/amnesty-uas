 UA 81/94 - Philippines: death threat: Sonia Soto | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 In recent weeks Sonia Soto, a 33-year-old human rights activist, has been threatened by men in plain clothes believed to be linked to the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Angeles City, Pampanga province. It is thought the threats are linked to her campaign on behalf of two peasant activists who were recently killed by armed men alleged to be members of the 172nd unit of the PNP."
