 Turkey: Ill-treatment / health concern | Amnesty International 
 Akbudak family, Karabas family, Karakas family, Lalealp family, Yiltas family, Varsak family and other families from Tepe village near Lice, Diyarbakir province: There is concern that members of the security forces have for over a month surrounded the hamlet of Tepe (local name: Gir), and are preventing the inhabitants from leaving or entering the village. There is concern that the inhabitants are also being deprived of food and essential medicines and that seventy per cent of the village population, consisting mainly of elderly men, women and children, are now said to require serious medical attention. Amnesty International believes such treatment to be cruel and inhuman and is urging the authorities to give the villagers immediate access to basic provisions and essential medical treatment.
