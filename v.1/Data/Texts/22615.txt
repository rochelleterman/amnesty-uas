 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned at press reports that  Alexander Mitchell and William Sampson have been          sentenced to death by a Saudi Arabian court following a   summary, secret and unfair trial. Their case may have     been referred to the King for ratification or clemency,   the final appeal stage of Saudi Arabia's secretive        judicial system. Amnesty International fears that the two prisoners may be at imminent risk of execution.           "
