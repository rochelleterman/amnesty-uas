 NA 
 On 19 October 1994, 22 people were killed and about 45 others wounded, when a bomb exploded on a bus in central Tel Aviv. The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) is reported to have claimed responsibility for the attack and there are fears that it may carry out further attacks against civilian targets."
