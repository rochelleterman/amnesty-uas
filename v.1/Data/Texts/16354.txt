 Recent information indicates that large numbers of Bosnian Muslim civilians continue to be held by Croatian Defence Council (HVO) forces. According to a report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), by 20 August some 15,000 Muslims were reported to be held in camps in Grbavica, Dretelj, Stolac, Ljubuski, Gabela, Rodoc and other places. The majority of them civilians expelled from their homes in Mostar, Capljina, Stolac and villages in the area. Conditions were reported to be particularly bad at Dretelj camp, where some 2,500 detainees were believed to be held by 20 August. There have also been reports that Muslim prisoners of war held at Rodoc have been made to perform forced labour for the HVO close to the front-lines. "
