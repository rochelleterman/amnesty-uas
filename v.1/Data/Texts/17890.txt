 Jordan:   Fear of deportation, detention and ill-treatment   Ibrahim Hamdi 'Atia Mursi.

 | Amnesty International 
 Ibrahim Hamdi 'Atia Mursi is currently being detained in Jordan and faces imminent deportation to Egypt. He is not known to have had any problem with the Egyptian authorities in the past. However, Amnesty International is concerned that if he is deported to Egypt, in the current political climate, he may be considered as a potential security threat by the Egyptian authorities and may be at risk of detention and ill-treatment.
