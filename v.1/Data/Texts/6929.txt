 UA 400/93 - Haiti: ""disappearance"": Elie Zephir | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Elie Zephir, a former soldier, has ""disappeared"" after being abducted from his home in Port-au-Prince on 3 November 1993. Reportedly several attaches, thought to be members of the Front Revolutionnaire pour l'Avancement et le Progres Haitien (FRAPH), broke down his door and took him away in the presence of his parents. When his family made enquiries after him at the police station, they were told by one officer that he ""no longer existed"". Other sources in the military have reportedly told the family that he was badly beaten and tortured and that he had been accused of being a Lavalassien, a supporter of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. His family have looked for him in vain at the General Hospital and at the morgue."
