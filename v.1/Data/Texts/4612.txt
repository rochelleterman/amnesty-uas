 Josue Giraldo Cardona, Pedro Malagon, Nelson Viloria and Jamis Ricardo Barrera are receiving death threats and their movements are being closely monitored by individuals believed to be working for the the State Security Service (DAS) and the police in the town of Villavicencio, Meta department. This follows the killing on 24 February of their colleague, Evaristo Amaya, who has held several public offices in Villavicencio. All are active members of the Union Patriotica (UP) party. On 16 July 1993 more then 10 UP workers, including the above named, presented an accion de tutela requesting official protection from harassment. This was approved by the regional court in Meta, but later revoked by the Supreme Court. Since then threats and harassment have increased."
