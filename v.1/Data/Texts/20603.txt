 USA: Further information: Canadian citizen faces unfair trial in weeks: Omar Khadr | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 An Appeal Court judge has stayed an order requiring Canada to propose remedies for violations suffered by Omar Khadr, a Canadian citizen who has been in US custody for eight years. Unless the US authorities drop plans to try Omar Khadr before a military commission, he could face an unfair trial within weeks for crimes allegedly committed when he was a child. "
