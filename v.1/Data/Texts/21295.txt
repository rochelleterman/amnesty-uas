 The German authorities are preparing to forcibly return asylum-seeker Mohamed Abdelrahman Ferah to Eritrea. If returned, he is at risk of arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention, torture or other ill-treatment for evasion of compulsory military service and for seeking asylum abroad, which the Eritrean authorities regard as a betrayal of the country."
