 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Unacknowledged detention: Dr Bajram Redzepagic | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Bajram Redzepagic, a kidney specialist working in the former military hospital in Sarajevo, has not been seen since 27 February 1995, when he was reportedly taken from his workplace. There are reports of his being held at an army barracks in the town but this has not been confirmed officially. He is not believed to be a member of any opposition party but has expressed criticism of the policies of the Bosnian Government. His political opinions may be the motive for his detention."
