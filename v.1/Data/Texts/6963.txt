 UA 322/94 - Haiti: fear for safety: Gabriel Louine, Romain Castri | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Gabriel Louine and Romain Castri were reportedly arrested by attaches in Delmas 60, Port-au-Prince, on 9 August 1994. In violation of the constitution, neither have been brought before a judge, and they are reportedly being denied access to relatives. They are currently being held at the Anti-gang investigation and research service in Port-au-Prince, and there is concern for their safety after repeated reports of torture having taken place there."
