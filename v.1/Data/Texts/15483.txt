 United Kingdom: Further information on impunity / legal concern: Augusto Pinochet | Amnesty International 
 On 17 December 1998 the House of Lords overturned the earlier ruling that refused Augusto Pinochet immunity from prosecution. The decison followed an appeal by Pinochet's lawyers arguing that because of Lord Hoffman's connection with Amnesty International Charity Ltd the ruling had been prejudiced. A new Lords' hearing has been scheduled for mid-January 1999.
