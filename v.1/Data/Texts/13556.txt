 ""Disappearance""/fear of torture or ill-treatment/health concern: Professor Sivasubramanium Raveendranath (m) 

 | Amnesty International 
 Professor Sivasubramanium Raveendranath, the Vice-Chancellor of Eastern University, was reportedly abducted while at a conference in the capital, Colombo, on 15 December. Since he was in an area tightly controlled by the military, it seems likely that his captors are an armed group operating with the tacit support of the security forces. He is at risk of torture. He suffers from heart disease, putting his life in greater danger.
