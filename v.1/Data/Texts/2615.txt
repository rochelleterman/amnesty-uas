 There is concern at the reported arrest on 10 March 1994 by security officials of about 30 people, including those named above. The arrests took place at a house in Khartoum where relatives and friends were gathering to commemorate the anniversary in the Islamic calendar of the summary execution of 28 army officers on 24 April 1990. It has been reported that some of those detained were assaulted at the time. Their place of detention is unknown, and there is concern for their safety. It is believed that those arrested are prisoners of conscience. Two women, Zakia and Mahassin, widows of two of the executed officers, were also arrested, but have since been released."
