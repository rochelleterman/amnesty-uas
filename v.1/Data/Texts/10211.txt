 AI is concerned about reports of killings in circumstances suggesting extrajudicial execution. Most occurred on 27 November 1992, the day that members of the armed forces tried to overthrow the government of Carlos Andres Perez, the second such attempt this year. Ernesto Leal Hernandez, a university student, was reportedly killed by members of the Metropolitan Police; Atahualpa Perez was found handcuffed and shot in the head; Clara Ariza was reportedly shot by a member of the National Guard as she left her house; Johnny Vergara, a television production assistant, was reportedly detained and shot in the centre of Caracas. Unconfirmed reports indicate that at least 63 prisoners were killed in a police operation to quell an escape attempt from El Reten de Catia Prison. "
