 NA 
 Dr Pham Hong Son, who has been in prison    since March   2002, is reportedly suffering from an         inguinal    hernia for which he has not received adequate    medical  care. AI recognises Dr Pham Hong Son as a prisoner of     conscience, and is calling for his immediate and          unconditional release.  In addition, AI is calling on the authorities to provide him with the immediate care he     needs                                                     "
