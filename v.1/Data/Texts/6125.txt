Catarina Terraza Chavez is a leader of CONAVIGUA, an organization of women who lost their husbands during the ferocious counter-insurgency campaigns in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was reportedly assaulted in January 1994, by the same G-2 member and a colleague, when she was 7 months pregnant.
