"Ukraine: Further information on death penalty / legal concern: Sergey Vysochansky 
 NA 
 Amnesty International has received information that the defence lawyers for Sergey Vysochansky are being denied access to information on the case at the Supreme Court. Sergey Vysochansky was sentenced to death for murder at Khmelnitsky regional court on 14 July 1996. His sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 August 1996. There continues to be concern that his conviction was unsafe, based on a confession which he later retracted claiming it had been made under duress.
