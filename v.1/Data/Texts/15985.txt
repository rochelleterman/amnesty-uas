 On 17 June 1996 political prisoner Badri Zarandia was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court. He has no right of appeal, and his only recourse against execution is to petition President Shevardnadze for clemency. Unofficial sources also claim that Badri Zarandia, who had a leg amputated in detention, and his five co-defendants were ill-treated in order to force a confession.
