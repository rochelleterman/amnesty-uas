 On 10 December, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Belarusian citizen Igor Koktysh, a male social activist, supporter of the Belarusian opposition and musician, should not be extradited to Belarus. The Ukrainian authorities have not yet indicated whether and when they will comply with this judgement. Igor Koktysh is a prisoner of conscience, held for the peaceful expression of his beliefs."
