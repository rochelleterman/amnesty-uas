 Pakistan: Further information on death penalty / Imminent execution, Rubina Khan | Amnesty International 
 A new execution date of 5 August has been set for Rubina Khan, who was convicted of murdering an elderly woman in her home. She denies claims that she has confessed and maintains her innocence. Doubts appear about her guilt. Strong evidence also indicates that international standards for fair trial were grossly violated during her trial.
