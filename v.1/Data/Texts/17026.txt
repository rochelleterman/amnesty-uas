 Iran: Legal concern/Possible Death Penalty | Amnesty International 
 Navid Balazadeh, Nejat Beroukhim, Farhad Seleh, Shahrokh  Paknahad, Ramin Farzam, Farzad Kashi, Faramarz Kashi,     Aasher Zadmehr (aka Shekasteh Band), Nasser Yaghoub Levy  Haim (Leveeim), Javeed Beit Yaghoub, Ramin Nemati, Danny  Tefileen, Omid Tefileen. Amnesty International is         concerned that the 13 people named above may be at risk   of unfair trial and could face the death penalty if       convicted. News reports citing the Iranian authorities    state that they have been accused of spying for Israel    and the US, and are to be prosecuted in a Revolutionary   Court on espionage charges. Espionage carries the death   penalty in Iran. Lawyers and observers are excluded from  trials at Revolutionary Courts, where trials often fall   short of minimum international fair trial standards.
