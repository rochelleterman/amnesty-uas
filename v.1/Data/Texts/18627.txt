 Dr Nour al-Din al-Atassi, former President of Syria, died of cancer on 3 December 1992 in Paris. A former prisoner of conscience who had been detained without charge or trial since November 1970, he was released in August 1992 on grounds of ill-health. Fourteen other government and Ba'ath Party officials arrested after the coup of 1970 are still held without charge or trial in al-Mezze Prison. "
