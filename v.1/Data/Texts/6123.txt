 NA 
 A renewed series of death threats has been made against Axel Mejia, a street educator with Covenant House (Casa Alianza), a refuge for street children. Anonymous telephone calls threatening Axel Mejia were made to staff at the Casa Alianza boys' Crisis Centre on 2 and 3 March 1993. AI is also concerned about the beating of Jose Antonio Higureos, a street youth aged 20 on 1 March 1993, allegedly by two plainclothes members of the National Police. Casa Alianza staff have been subjected to intimidation since they began to denounce human rights violations against street children in Guatemala. "
