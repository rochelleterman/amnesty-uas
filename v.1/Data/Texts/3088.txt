 UA 326/94 - Togo: ""disappearance"" / fear of extrajudicial killing: David Bruce | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of David Bruce, a civil servant in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after he was abducted on 6 September 1994 by armed men, believed to be in collusion with the armed forces. A witness claimed that the men stated they were taking David Bruce to the Gendarmerie headquarters. His current whereabouts are unknown. It is believed he may have been targeted because of his activities during the political transition period when between 1991 and 1993 he was a senior adviser to the President of the High Council of the Republic (HCR)."
