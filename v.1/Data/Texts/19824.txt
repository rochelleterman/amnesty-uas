 Brazil: Forced eviction | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Over 400 families were forcibly evicted from a government building on 16 June 2009; more than 200 families are now encamped in extremely precarious conditions in an enclosed space under a viaduct in the centre of SÃ£o Paulo. Supported by local NGOs, the families plan to stay under the viaduct until the authorities offer them adequate alternative housing."
