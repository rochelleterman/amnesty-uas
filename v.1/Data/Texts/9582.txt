 EXTRA 68/94 - USA (Indiana): Gregory Resnover (aka Ajamu Nassor) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Gregory Resnover, black, is scheduled to be executed in Indiana on 8 December 1994. He was convicted, with another man, Tommie Smith, of the murder of a white police sergeant in 1980. In a petition for clemency in November 1994 Gregory Resnovers attorneys argued that the jury at his trial was seriously misled when it was told that he and Tommie Smith were equally culpable of the homicide. Charges against Earl Resnover were dismissed for lack of evidence but he had reportedly been found to have large amounts of gunshot residue on his hands. The attorney who prosecuted Resnover and the Indian State Representative both now publicly oppose his execution."
