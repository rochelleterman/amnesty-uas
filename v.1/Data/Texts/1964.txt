 UA 240/93 - Senegal: torture: Mody Sy, Ramata Gueye | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Mody Sy, a recently elected member of parliament representing the opposition Parti democratique senegalais (PDS) was arrested on 20 May 1993 and held for one week at the Gendarmerie station in Thiong Street, central Dakar. There he was reportedly tortured to make him confess to providing weapons used in the murder of a prominent lawyer earlier that month. On 11 June he was examined by a military doctor, but to date his lawyer has not been granted access to the medical report, and no investigation has been opened into his allegations of torture. In a related case Ramata Gueye was arrested on 14 July and also subjected to torture. She was released uncharged after two days in custody. Lawyers in the case have announced she will be making a formal complaint. "
