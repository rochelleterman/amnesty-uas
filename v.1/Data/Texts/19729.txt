 Tanzania: Fear for safety/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Police have beaten up Ayube Bakari   Ismail Jusab         officials, and Salum Dimani, officials of Zanzibar's      opposition party the Civic United Front (CUF), as the     island prepares for a re-run of elections on 5 November   in several constitutencies where there were serious       irregularities. Without immediate action to address       police brutality and torture, opposition activists,       journalists and others in Zanzibar are likely to face     further police violence and torture."
