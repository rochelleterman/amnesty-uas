 Demonstrations in Islamshahr, a suburb of Tehran, on 4 April 1995, during which up to 10 people may have been shot dead by Revolutionary Guards, have been followed by hundreds of arrests. The detainees are reportedly held in an undisclosed prison, denied access to relatives. AI fears that they may be tortured in detention. AI also fears they they may not receive fair trials and that some could face the death penalty."
