 Iraq: Fear of torture/fear of execution/legal concern			 | Amnesty International 
 According to press reports, two men, Hamza Qassim Sabbat, (also known as Abu Haitham) and Ibrahim ïAbd al-Jasim Mohammad, (also known as Abu Ayub), appeared on Iraqi national television yesterday and confessed their involvement in ""terrorist acts"" inside Iraq for the benefit of a foreign country. Amnesty International is concerned that their confessions may have been extracted under torture and that televised statements may have an impact upon the fairness of their trial. The two men are also at risk of being sentenced to death and executed.
