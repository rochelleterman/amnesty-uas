 NA 
 Kurdish lawyer Yavuz Yilmaz has ""disappeared"" after being detained on 29 April 1994 in Istanbul by eight men in plain clothes. They allegedly introduced themselves as members of the ""political police"" in Elazig. They took him to the police headquarters in Istanbul, then a few days later he was transferred to the Police Headquarters in Elazig. The authorities, however, have denied that he is being held. He is a member of the Democracy Party (DEP) and has previously been the victim of detention, torture and death threats."
