 Mahfuz Elci was released on 18 November. He is said to have been tortured in detention. The other 14 people, including those named above, continue to be held at the Gendarmerie Brigade Headquarters in Mus, and there is concern that they too are being tortured under interrogation. There is particular concern for Omer Celik and Huseyin Ogurlu in view of their advanced age."
