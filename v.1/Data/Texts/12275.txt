 Malaysia: Possible prisoners of conscience / ill-treatment / denial of medical treatment: 42 members of the Dayak Iban indigenous community | Amnesty International 
 42 members of the Dayak Iban indigenous community were arrested on 25 June 1997 in connection with a dispute with an oil palm plantation company over their native customary land. Amnesty International believes that those remaining in detention are possible prisoners of conscience who may have been detained solely on account of lawful peaceful activities in protest at the commercial development of their native customary land.
