 Further information on UA 382/92 (MDE 13/22/92, 3 December) - Iran: fear of torture / death penalty / unfair trial: Abdollah Bagheri | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI has received a response from the Iranian authorities about the case of Abdollah Bagheri, a former member of the Kurdish opposition group Komala who was arrested at the beginning of November 1992. The response alleges that he is a high-ranking official of Komala and is ""responsible for many murders"". He is to be tried on charges of undertaking terrorist attacks. AI is concerned that trial proceedings in Iran fall short of international standards of fairness and fears that Abdollah Bagheri may be in danger of ill-treatment or execution following an unfair trial.
