 Kazakstan: Further Information Death penalty/torture/ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 On 18 December Mikhail Vershinin, Evgeniy Turochkin and Sergey Kopay will reach the end of a one-year reprieve on their death sentences and are in serious danger of being executed at any time. Five prisoners on death row with Mikhail Vershinin were reportedly secretly executed in October and November and Mikhail Vershinin believes that he is next. His only hope of staying alive now depends on President Nursultan Nazarbayev granting clemency.
