 UA 03/93 - Algeria: prolonged incommunicado detention / fear of torture: Djamaleddine Hamadi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Djamaleddine Hamadi, a 30-year-old teacher, was arrested on 19 December 1992 and has since been held incommunicado beyond the 12-day legal maximum allowed under new anti-terrorist legislation. He was reportedly taken from his home by armed members of the security forces who are said to have entered his house by force, without showing any arrest warrant. His family have been given no information regarding his whereabouts or reasons for his continued detention. However, AI has received reports that he is held at the Chateauneuf Police Station in Algiers and that he has been tortured. "
