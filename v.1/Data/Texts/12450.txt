 Prem Parajuli, a human rights activist from the Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC) was released today on bail. He was arrested on 25 June 1993 and charged under the Public Crime and Punishment Act when he went to gather information after the police had intervened when demonstrations following a strike by the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) (CPN-UML) turned violent. At least 12 people were shot dead by police and over 300 arrested. Human rights activists who were allowed to interview some of the 134 detainees at Mahendra Police Club detention centre said that they had been ill-treated and tortured during interrogation by police. It is believed that as many as 150 people may still be detained without charge. "
