 The first two people named above, a woman and a man, were detained during a police operation in the Sincan district of Ankara on 5 June 1993. The third, Sevinc Sahingoz (female), was brought from Yozgat and is reportedly being interrogated with the others at the Anti-Terror Branch of Ankara Police Headquarters. Police have permission to hold them incommunicado until 18 June. There is particular concern about the health of Aysu Baykal, who suffers from kidney problems."
