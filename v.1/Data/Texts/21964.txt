 Iran: Further information on arbitrary arrests/prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The seven people named above, all members of the Baha'i religious minority, are to go on trial shortly, on charges of ""espionage for Israel, insulting religious sanctities and propaganda against the system"". Amnesty International considers the charges to be politically motivated and those held to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely because of their conscientiously held beliefs or their peaceful activities on behalf of the Baha'i community. If convicted, they would face lengthy prison terms, or even the death penalty. "
