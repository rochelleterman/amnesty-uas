 Iran: Possible prisoner of conscience: Roxana Saberi (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Journalist Roxana Saberi, who is a dual US-Iranian national, was arrested on 31 January. She is currently detained in Tehran's Evin Prison. Amnesty International is concerned that she may be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of expression in the course of her work as a journalist."
