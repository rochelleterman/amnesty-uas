 Another activist with Ocana's Popular Housing and Self-Building Association (ASOVIPA) has been attacked. Hermes Rendon was shot dead on 24 October 1994 when he was attacked with the son of a friend of his, Cesar Augusto Quintero, by two gunmen in the Canaveral district of Ocana town, in the Ocana region of Norte de Santander. Cesar Augusto Quintero has been taken to hospital with leg wounds and his condition is said to be serious. Local inhabitants reportedly recognized the gunmen as being members of a paramilitary force operating with impunity in the Ocana area under the names: ""Los Tuneros"", ""Mano Negra""and COLSINGUE."
