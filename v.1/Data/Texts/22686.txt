 Saudi Arabia: Health concern | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amir Hussain, a Bangladeshi national detained in the al-Shumaisi deportation centre in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, is believed to be denied access to medical care for a serious health problem. Amnesty Internationalâ€™s concerns are heightened by reports that another Bangladeshi national, Haas Muhammad Muzamdar, a 26-year-old computer engineer, died in the same deportation centre in the early hours of 19 December 2008 after apparently also being denied medical care.
