 Turkmenistan: Arbitrary detention/Fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Seven people (Ogulsapar Muradova, Sana Muradova, Maral Muradov, Berdy Muradov, Elena Ovezova, Annakurban Amanklychev and Sapardurdy Khadzhiev) were detained between 16 and 19 June and are at risk of torture. They appear to have been detained solely because they are members, or relatives of members, of the non-governmental human rights organisation Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation (THF), which has publicised human rights violations in the country. They are believed to be held at the Interior Ministry building in the capital, Ashgabat.
