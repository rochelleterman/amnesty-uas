 Turkey: Torture / health concern: Turabi Kisin | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Turabi Kisin is in incommunicado detention at the Anti-Terror branch of Istanbul Police headquarters. According to the testimony of another political prisoner, he had been badly tortured and is now in very poor health. This is his fourth time in detention. After his most recent imprisonment he reportedly required several months in hospital, due to torture. At the time of his arrest he was reportedly suffering from active tuberculosis and severe rheumatism. Turbai Kisin's family has allegedly been harassed by the security forces since one of his brothers, who had joined the PKK guerrillas, was killed in fighting in 1992."
