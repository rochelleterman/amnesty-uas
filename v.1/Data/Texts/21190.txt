 Pakistan: Targeted killing of health professionals: Medical Action. | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 In mid-March 2002 when an Amnesty International           delegation reached Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan, three doctors from the Shi'a minority community  had been shot dead, three had survived attempts on their lives and seven had reportedly migrated within the previous week.   The Government of Pakistan  has on several occasions      condemned sectarian violence. Amnesty International       believes, however, that the government has systematically failed to exercise due diligence when it failed to        prevent abuses against specific religious communities, to investigate such abuses and to punish the perpetrators.
