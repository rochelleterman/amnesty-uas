 Kosovo: Fear of extrajudicial executions in police operations / possible excessive use of force | Amnesty International 
 Extrajudicial executions and other human rights violations have been reported in the Drenica region of Kosovo province during police operations, and there are fears that further similar operations may be planned in the region. Reports suggest that some ethnic Albanians killed may not have been involved in the fighting, or may have been disarmed beforehand, and there are concerns that the use of force by Serbian security forces has far exceeded that permitted by international standards for law enforcement.
