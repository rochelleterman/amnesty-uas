 UA 440/93 - Guatemala: death threats: Graciela Esther Barrios Marroquin | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Graciela Esther Barrios Maroquin, a worker with the Catholic NGO Caritas, has reportedly been threatened with death if she does not give up her work with Caritas in El Quiche. She apparently first received threats by mail in July 1993, two years after the killing of her husband. Subsequent threats were made in September and December. Her sister was abducted and found murdered in 1985. In both cases the circumstances of the killings suggested the involvement of the security forces."
