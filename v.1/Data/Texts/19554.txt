 Since 13 May 2009, thousands of villagers have been displaced and thousands more are trapped in the cross fire between the Joint Task Force and armed groups in Delta State, South West Nigeria. The JTF attacks on the communities in the area are continuing on a daily basis, reportedly because they believe the armed groups are hiding in the communities."
