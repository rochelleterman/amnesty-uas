 Workers' leader Eliud Almaguer Aldape is safe and well.   All the Duro workers arrested on 19 June have been        released on bail. The Duro management and state           authorities have reportedly continued to pressure the     workers to withdraw their demands. It is unclear what the final agreement will be and the workers are continuing    their peaceful protest, calling for the recognition of an independent union and to improve work and pay conditions.
