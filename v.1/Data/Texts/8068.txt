 Susana Roque Castro (f), aged 34, Rosa Cardenas R (f), aged 46: The above women were reportedly arbitrarily detained on the night of 25 April 1997 and there are fears that they may be at risk of torture while in the custody of the DINCOTE, the anti-terrorism branch of the national police. They were arrested after paying condolences to the family of Rolly Rojas, a member of the MRTA killed during the operation to end the hostage crisis at the Japanese Ambassador's residence. Susana Roque and Rosa Cardenas are the sister and wife respectively of two MRTA prisoners.
