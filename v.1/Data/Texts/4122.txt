 EXTRA 84/92 - Chile: ""disappearance"" / legal concern: Alfonso Chanfreau Oyarce | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 22 October 1992, the Chilean Supreme Court will determine the fate of the investigations into the 1974 ""disappearance"" of Alfonso Chanfreau Oyarce, a 24-year-old philosophy student and leader of the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionario. If the case is transferred to the military courts, it is likely to be closed on the basis of the 1978 Amnesty Law, which has been used repeatedly by the military courts to block investigations into human rights violations. Amnesty International remains seriously concerned about the impunity of those responsible for human rights violations under the former military government and urges the Chilean authorities to ensure that investigations continue and those responsible are brought to justice "
