 Three unidentified people reportedly attacked teenagers Cristina and Matea Par, members of the indigenous umbrella organization Coordinadora Maya Majawil Q'Ij. The girls were attacked close to Majawil Q'Ij's offices in Guatemala City on 19 October 1992. The attack is reportedly linked to their participation in the celebrations following the award of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize to indigenous leader Rigoberta Menchu. The assailants allegedly beat the girls and removed their clothes, saying that their indigenous dress demonstrated that they were guerrillas and reportedly threatened to kill them. "
