"Sudan: Fear for Safety/ Incommunicado Detention 
 Sudan: Fear for Safety/ Incommunicado Detention | Amnesty International 
 Human rights lawyers Mossaad Mohamed Ali (m) and Adam Mohamed Shareif (m), who work with the Amel Centre, were detained on 16 May by the National Security Agency (NSA) and are held incommunicado, putting them at risk of torture. They are well-known because of their work, and detaining them sends a clear message to victims of rape and torture that no one in Darfur who attempts to stand up for the rights of the victims is safe.
