 Liu Shushu was executed on 16 September 1995, 12 days after being sentenced to death. He had been convicted on 4 September for bombing Guangzhou railway station on 5 August 1995, reportedly after hearing that his college had threatened to expel him. The execution came two days after Guangdong Intermediate Court rejected his appeal against the death penalty."
