 Mexico: Fear of torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Two human rights defenders (Yesica Sænchez Maya and Aline Castellanos Jurado) who have been documenting and publicising human rights violations that have taken place in Oaxaca since the beginning of widespread protests in June, are now apparently facing arrest on charges which appear to be baseless. Other human rights activists arrested during the Oaxaca protests have been reportedly tortured and ill treated in custody, and it is feared that these two women could face the same treatment.
