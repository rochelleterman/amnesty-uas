 Yemen: Further information: Journalist freed but still faces charges: Muhammad al-Maqalih | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Yemeni journalist Muhammad al-Maqalih, who was detained in the capital, Sana’a, for over six months, was released on 25 March. However, he is facing charges of “defaming the President”, broadcasting information against security forces, and supporting followers of the cleric Hussein al-Huthi. The last two charges carry the death penalty. Amnesty International believes that he has been targeted solely for his criticism of the government’s policies in the armed conflict in the north of Yemen."
