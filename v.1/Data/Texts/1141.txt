 Proceedings in the trial of Koigi wa Wamwere and his co-defendants came to an abrupt halt earlier this week when their counsel was denied the right to present the final submission orally. AI has adopted all four as prisoners of conscience and is concerned that they face mandatory death sentence if convicted. AI believes the charges against them to be false and that they have not received a fair trial. AI continues to call for their immediate and unconditional release."
