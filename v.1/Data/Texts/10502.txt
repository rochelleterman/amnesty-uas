 According to the authorities, Khin Zaw Win has confessed to meeting with foreign journalists and diplomats and giving them information critical of the government . He is also alleged to have exchanged information with a member of an armed opposition group and, with others, ""made arrangements for sending fabricated news on Myanmar"" to the UN Special Rapporteur during his visit in December 1993. Legal action is to be taken against him. AI believes these allegations to be politically motivated and is also concerned about his treatment in detention."
