 Yemen: Testimony of the 'disappeared' in the 'war on terror'. Action sheet 3 - Yemeni Authorities | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Muhammad Faraj Ahmed Bashmilah and Salah Nasser Salim 'Ali, both Yemeni nationals, say they were held by US authorities in underground, incommunicado detention for over eighteen months. They had previously been tortured. Both were released in March 2005 and returned to Yemen where they continue to be detained without charge or trial. Walid Muhammad Shahir Muhammad al-Qadasi was released from Guant√°namo Bay in April 2004. He remains detained in Yemen without charge or trial. In this action sheet, Amnesty International calls on the Yemeni Authorities to: stop secret detention; investigate all allegations of torture; and to release or try these individuals fairly."
