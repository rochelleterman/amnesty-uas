 Brazil: Fear for Safety | Amnesty International 
 Some 400 members of the Guarani-Kaiowæ indigenous community in Cerro Marangatu are facing eviction from farm land in southwestern Brazil that they occupied after it was allocated to them by the government. The community will be left destitute, and have threatened to commit mass suicide. The eviction, ordered by a court early this year, is believed to be scheduled for 20 January. Police and others have previously used excessive force in carrying out similar eviction orders.
