 On 21 March 1995, President Yeltsin rejected the proposed amendments to the criminal code which would have introduced a possible death sentence for a new offence of ""organizing, or participating in, illegal armed formations"". The refusal to sign was on the grounds that the amendments were unconstitutional. They were returned to the State Duma for further discussion."
