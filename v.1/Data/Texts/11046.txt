 NA 
 76-year-old Bishop Zeng Jingmu, detained on or around 22 November 1995, is reported to be suffering from pneumonia which he contracted while detained in October. He did not receive medical care for the condition then, heightening concern that he may not now be receiving adequate medical care. AI believes that Zeng Jingmu is a prisoner of conscience and should be immediately and unconditionally released."
