 Turkmenistan: Further information on Torture and ill-treatment, Dmitry Melnichenko | Amnesty International 
 Conscientious objector Dmitry Melnichenko, is now serving in an army medical unit in the town of Serdar (formerly Kizyl-Arvat) in western Turkmenistan. He has been visited by a group of fellow Baptists who report that he is content with his situation because he does not have to carry arms. No criminal charges have been brought against him despite his refusal to swear an oath of military allegiance.
