 Cuba: Further information on arbitrary detention / harassment | Amnesty International 
 Arrests of members of Concilio Cubano have continued. There is particular concern at reports of the rearrest on 27 February of Rafael Solano, director of the independent press agency 'Habana Press'. His family have also received anonymous death threats. Reinaldo Casno Alen and Dr Rene Gomez Manzano were released after a few days, but some reports have indicated that Dr Manzano may have been rearrested. Dr Leonel Morejon Almagro was tried on 23 February at a municipal court in Havana and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. It is believed that the charges against Dr Morejon and Lazaro Gonzalez Valdes, sentenced to 14 months' imprisonment the day before, are politically motivated and that they are prisoners of conscience.
