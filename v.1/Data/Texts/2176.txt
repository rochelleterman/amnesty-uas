 UA 59/94 - South Africa (Bophuthatswana): legal concern / fear of torture / prisoner of conscience: Nathaniel Ngakantsi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Nathaniel Ngakantsi, who is being held in unacknowledged incommunicado detention, following his arrest on 17 February 1994 by Bophuthatswana police. An executive member of the African National Congress (ANC), Mafikeng Branch, he is believed to be a prisoner of conscience, arrested as part of a campaign of harassment of non-violent political activists during the run-up to South Africa's first non-racial elections. He was arrested at Mmabatho Shopping Complex after he addressed a meeting called by the Mafikeng ANC Youth League, which was dispersed by the police."
