 UA 259/94 - South Africa: extrajudicial execution / fear for safety: Blessing Vusumuzi Ntuli, and members of the Ntuli family | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of members of the family of Blessing Vusumuzi Ntuli, who was shot dead outside his home in Gezinsila township, Eshowe, KwaZulu-Natal, on 20 June 1994. He had been subjected recently to death threats from men in a nearby squatter area known as the ""Scrapyard"", who are reported to have said that they did not want supporters of the ANC living in the area. They appear to include Inkath Freedom Party (IFP) supporters who received paramilitary training from members of the former Kwazulu ""homeland"" police. Since 22 June aggressive crowds have gathered outside the Ntuli house or in the Scrapyard, and sometimes members of the crowd have fired at the house with automatic weapons and rifles."
