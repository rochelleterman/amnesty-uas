 Dr Alemayehu Teferra is held under a court order on the basis of documentary evidence of past human rights violations. Of the 18 students detained on 22 April, some have been released, but about eight are still believed to be detained without charge. They include Teshome Bimerew, who is held in the police Central Investigation prison, apparently accused of possessing a leaflet of the All-Amhara People's Organization (AAPO), an opposition party formed in January 1992. The AAPO leaflets are not reported to advocate violence. "
