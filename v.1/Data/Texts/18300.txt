 UA 333/94 - Saudi Arabia: fear of torture or ill-treatment: Dr 'Abdullah al-Hamed, Dr Muhsin al-'Awaji | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 'Dr Abdullah al-Hamed and Dr Muhsin al-'Awaji were both arrested by members of General Intelligence on 8 September 1994. Dr 'Abdullah al-Hamed is a writer and a lecturer at Imam Muhammad bin Saud University in Riyadh, and was one of the six founding members of the Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights (CDLR) in Saudi Arabia. Both men had been arrested in 1993, during which time Dr al-Hamed was tortured. Both men are considered to be prisoners of conscience, and there is concern they may be tortured or ill-treated while in incommunicado detention."
