 Brazil: Fear for safety/ forced eviction: About 500 members of the Patax처 H찾h찾h찾e indigenous community

 | Amnesty International 
 About 500 members of the Patax H쮐쮐쮍 indigenous community in Bahia state, northeastern Brazil, are in imminent danger of violent eviction from their ancestral lands. They are occupying the land in protest against the failure of the judicial system to enact its transfer to the indigenous community. Gunmen hired by local landowners are circulating in the area, and Federal Police have gathered around the protesters. Given that recent evictions in similar circumstances have been violent, there are fears that the lives of the Patax H쮐쮐쮍 may be in imminent danger.
