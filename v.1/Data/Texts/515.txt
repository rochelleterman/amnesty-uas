 Fears for the safety of civilians in the Logone district of southern Chad have been raised by the reported killing by the Chadian army of more than 25 people, including a pregnant woman and juveniles, on 13 August 1994. The army launched attacks on civilians in Kaga district between 12 and 14 August, after fighting between the army and the FARF, an armed opposition group, in which five soldiers died. The army reportedly burnt several villages. In Kaga town, the head of the town and some village chiefs were reportedly tied up and beaten. One of them reportedly remains paralysed as a result."
