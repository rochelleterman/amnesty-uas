 Serbia and Montenegro (Kosovo): Health concern | Amnesty International 
 The health of some 530 residents of displaced persons' camps in the Mitrovica region of northern Kosovo is at risk due to lead pollution from a disused lead-smelting site near the camps. Most of those living in the three camps, including 138 children under the age of six, have dangerous levels of lead in their blood. Some of the children have suffered symptoms of lead poisoning, including convulsions and coma, suggesting very high levels of exposure. According to the UN World Health Organization (WHO), children living at the camps ""are at a true risk of encephalopathy [brain disorder] and possible death"".
