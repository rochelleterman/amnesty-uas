 At a re-sentencing hearing scheduled to begin on 12       August in Petersburg, Virginia, the prosecutor intends to seek a death sentence against Shermaine Johnson.  The     crime he has been convicted of committing occurred in     1994 when he was 16 years old. International law,         respected in almost every country in the world, prohibits the use of the death penalty against people who were      under 18 at the time of the crime.
