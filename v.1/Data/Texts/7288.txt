 Further information on: Mexico: Fear for safety/death threats: Lydia Cacho Ribeiro (f) | Amnesty International 
 Fears for the safety of Lydia Cacho Ribeiro have increased, after a Mexican national newspaper published the transcripts of telephone conversations allegedly involving state authorities, including the Governor of Puebla, and important businessmen, apparently plotting to silence her through judicial harassment. Amnesty International believes that the alleged content of the conversations now in the public domain makes her more vulnerable to further threats and reprisals.
