Amnesty International remains deeply concerned for the    safety of independent journalists in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as new reports of repression of the media  emerge. On 24 April 1999, Miodrag Perovi , the founder of the Montenegrin independent weekly magazine Monitor and   the independent radio station Antena M, reportedly went   into hiding after an unsuccessful attempt by the Federal  Yugoslav military authorities to deliver an arrest        warrant to him. The exact nature of the charges contained in the warrant is not known. It appears, however, that    Miodrag Perovi 's refusal to obey requests of the         Yugoslav Army to stop transmitting foreign broadcasts,    including those of the BBC and the Voice of America, and  the criticism which his media outlets have levelled at    the Yugoslav Army and police operations in Kosovo         province, are the motive behind the authorities' actions."
