 Peru: Further information on ""disappearance"": Pedro Yauri Bustamante | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is profoundly dismayed by reports that, three years after Peruvian journalist Pedro Yauri Bustamante was abducted, the investigation into his subsequent ""disappearance"" has been closed. His fate has never been clarified and the perpetrators have remained at large. Pedro Yauri is believed to have been killed by members of the army shortly after his abduction on 24 June 1992."
