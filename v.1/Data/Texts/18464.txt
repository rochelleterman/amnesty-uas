 Syria: Further information on Prisoner of conscience/Fear of torture/Legal concern, Mamun al-Humsi, 45, member of the Syrian   Parliament | Amnesty International 
 The three relatives of Mamun al-Humsi - Riad Sairafi, Ahmad Sairafi and Jamal al-Masri - were arrested on 26 December, after they applauded him at the latest hearing of his trial, at the Damascus Criminal Court. They are apparently without access to lawyers or their family, and may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Amnesty International considers all three to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful expression of their opinions.
