 Farzad Kamangar was arrested by Ministry of Intelligence officials along with two other members of the Kurdish minority, Ali Heydariyan and Farhad Vakili, in Tehran around July 2006. On 24 November, prison guards entered Farzad Kamangarâ€™s cell and reportedly beat him, threatened him with execution, and took him out of the cell. Later that day, another prisoner reported seeing him in the prison clinic, apparently unconscious. Farzad Kamangar is now believed to have been returned to his cell. . "
