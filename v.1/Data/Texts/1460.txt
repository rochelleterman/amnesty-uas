 Dahanna Ould Sidi Mahmoud Ould Salah was released without charge on 16 or 17 October, along with at least six of the other detainees. Mauritanian newspapers reported that a total of 26 military officers were released, including several of the officers arrested after the alleged August coup attempt. Cheikh Ould Abdallahi is apparently still detained incommunicado at the police training school (Ecole de police) in the capital, Nouakchott. The five other named men have been charged with offences that carry the death penalty, and some have allegedly been tortured.
