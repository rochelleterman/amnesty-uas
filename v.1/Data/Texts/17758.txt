 Israel / South Lebanon: Further information on: incommunicado detention / fear of torture or ill-treatment: 'Ali Diya | Amnesty International 
 'Ali Diya, a Lebanese journalist working with Agence France Press (AFP) is still being held in Kishon Prison in Israel. On 8 July his detention was extended for a further 10 days by a court in Akka. On 9 July, after being detained incommunicado for almost a month, he was allowed to see a lawyer for the first time. He reportedly said that he had not been ill-treated. Amnesty International is calling on the authorities to either charge him with a recognizably criminal offence and try him fairly before a court, or release him immediately.
