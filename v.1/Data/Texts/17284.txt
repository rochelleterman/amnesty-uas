 Shi'a cleric Ayatollah Sayed Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi reportedly appeared before the Special Court for the Clergy in March 2007. According to an eyewitness, he      appeared to be bleeding from his mouth, and possibly      occasionally coughing up blood. He was reportedly unable  to walk upright. On 18 February, the cleric's eldest son, Sayed Mahdi Kazemeyni Boroujerdi, was arrested and was    detained in Evin Prison, although Amnesty International   is not aware of the reasons for his reported detention.
