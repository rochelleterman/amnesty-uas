 Administrative detainees Hassan Safadi and Samer al-Barq have been on hunger strike since 21 June and 22 May 2012 respectively. They have reportedly been repeatedly ill-treated by Israeli Prison Service (IPS) guards since 30 July. Their health was assessed by an independent doctor on 2 August and they need long-term specialized medical treatment which cannot be provided by the clinic in Ramleh prison."
