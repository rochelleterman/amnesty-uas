 Turkey: Prisoner of conscience / health concern: Hasan Dogan | Amnesty International 
 Hasan Dogan, a Kurdish lawyer and member of the Turkish Human Rights Association (IHD) has been arbitrarily detained in Malatya, southeast Turkey, since 6 May 1997. He is said to be suffering from a heart complaint and from high blood pressure. He was arrested following an argument with judges at a trial at Malatya DGM when his client retracted a confession made under duress. It appears he has been accused on the basis of testimony given by a ""confessor"". Amnesty International is calling for his immediate and unconditional release as a prisoner of conscience.
