 Sayed Ali Akbar Mousavi-Kho'ini, human rights defedender, was reportedly arrested during a peaceful demonstration in the capital, Tehran, which called for legal reforms to end discrimination against women in Iran. At least 69 other people were arrested, but all except Ali Akbar Mousavi-Kho'ini have since been released.
