 Following the execution of two men on 27 January 1994, there is concern that prisoners on death row, including some or all of the 15 people named above, may be at imminent risk of execution. The two men, in their late twenties, and identified only by the initials S.Sh. and Y.Q., were reportedly hung in Swaqa prison after conviction for murder and robbery."
