 NA 
 Two European volunteers for an international protection project based in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, were threatened in April. The volunteers – one French and one British – protect individuals and members of Honduran human rights organisations at risk of attack by accompanying them. The safety of the volunteers is now at risk."
