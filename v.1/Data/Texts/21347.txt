 On 31 October, a representative of the United Nations' Committee Against Torture (CAT) requested that Sweden does not return Terhas Mlash Abraha to Eritrea whilst the CAT is considering her case. She was released from detention on the same day and there is no present risk that she will face forced return to Eritrea."
