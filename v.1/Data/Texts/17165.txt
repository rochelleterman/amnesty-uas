 Iran: Fear for safety/Fear of torture/ill treatment | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International fears that Dr Hossein Ghaziyan,     Behrouz Geranpayeh and Abbas Abdi are at risk of ill      treatment and possibly torture. Their families do not     know where they are being held. There are fears that      Mohsen Goudarzi may also be in danger due to his          professional connection with the other detainees.
