 Mexico: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Alma Brisa Molina Baca was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua State, on 24 July. Her killing appears to fit the decade-long pattern of murders with sexual violence that the authorities have failed to prevent or end. Intense national and international pressure had recently reduced the number of such murders, but Amnesty International believes that this killing raises new concern for the safety of the women and girls of Ciudad Juarez.
