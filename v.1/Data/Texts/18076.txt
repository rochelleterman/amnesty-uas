 Fawzi al-Rasi, in his early thirties, reportedly died in custody on 22 April 1994. Official sources are reported to have said that he suffered a heart attack in the Ministry of Defence in Yarzeh, where he was being interrogated. Another detainee, Hanna 'Atiq, is reported to be in intensive care after interrogation. Both are members of the Lebanese Forces, an ex-militia turned political party. AI fears that both these events may have been the result of torture and is concerned that other detainees may be being tortured."
