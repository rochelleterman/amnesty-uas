 Saudi Arabia: Fear of torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Up to 11 people, including Dr Matrouk al-Falih, Dr Abdullah al-Hamid, Muhammad Sa'id Tayyab, Dr Tawfiq al-Qussayyir and Suleyman al-Rashudi, have been arrested since 15 March 2004, apparently for criticising the government-appointed human rights watchdog. They are reportedly held incommunicado at the General Intelligence (al-Mabahith al-'Amma) in 'Ulaysha, in the capital, Riyadh. Amnesty International is concerned that they may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment.
