 AI welcomes the acquittal on 11 January 1995 of Yavuz Onen, Fevzi Argun, Akin Birdal, Husnu Ondul and Sedat Aslantas, who were being tried for allegedly ""separatist"" statements in publications dealing with human rights. Not all of those acquitted were freed: Sedat Aslantas was returned to Andara Closed Prison, where he is serving a three-year-sentence imposed after a speech he made at a Human Rights Association meeting. AI considers him to be a prisoner of conscience."
