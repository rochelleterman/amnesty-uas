 NA 
 Former political prisoner Lotfi Dassi was arrested by security forces in Tunisia on 23 November, apparently in relation to his activities to secure financial aid for families affected by floods in the town of Redeyef. The authorities have not acknowledged that they are holding him. He may have been subjected to enforced disappearance and is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment."
