 Human rights lawyer Mohammad Ali Dadkhah was arrested on 8 July 2009 in the Iranian capital, Tehran, along with an unknown number of his colleagues. The reason for their arrest is not clear, but is likely to be related to their human rights activities and their peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression and association after the disputed presidential election. Amnesty International would consider them prisoners of conscience. They are at risk of torture."
