 Colombia: fear for safety / possible extrajudicial executions: Members of the Ascanio, Quintero and Perez Guerrero peasant farmer families | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Members of the Ascanio, Quintero and Perez Guerrero families living in Ocana province, Norte de Santander department, are being threatened and intimidated by the armed forces. Several members of these families have been killed or ""disappeared"" in recent months, so their is particular concern for their safety. The families moved to Ocana as a result of the violence in their own villages. The names of various members of these families have allegedly appeared on death lists circulated by paramilitaries active in the region. On 6 March 1995 Alirio Lopez Quintero was shot dead by armed gunmen. Ramon DAvid Ascanio was shot dead on 7 March. Previously, on 22 December 1994, Ramon Eli Ascanio and Carmen Emiro Ascanio were shot dead, apparently by paramilitary gunmen."
