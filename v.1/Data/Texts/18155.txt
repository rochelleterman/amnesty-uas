"Oman: Death penalty 
 Oman: Death penalty | Amnesty International 
 Five men, Habib bin Jum'a bin Sulayman; Ahmed bin Habib   bin Jum'a; Mohammad bin Habib bin Jum'a; Faisal bin Hilal bin Salem; and Najeeb bin Mahfoudh, have been sentenced   to death for murder in     Oman. As they cannot appeal    against their sentences, it   is feared that they will be executed once a legal         committee has ratified the  convictions.
