 Burundi: Fear of further extrajudicial executions: civilian population of suburb of Kamenge | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is gravely concerned about reports of killings of civilians by the Burundi army in the Kamenge suburb of Bujumbura. Many innocent civilians have been killed since 31 May. The wounded have no access to medical care or food and people are likely to be dying from starvation and exposure. This is the latest in a series of what appear to be efforts forcibly to remove the Hutu population from Bujumbura. Government officials and representatives of intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organization have had only limited access to kamenge. AI fears that there will be further killings of unarmed civilians."
