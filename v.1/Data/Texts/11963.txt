 The trial of Kim Sen (Kim San) and Meas Minear, human     rights    workers, began on 8 July 1999, both charged     with inciting demonstrators to use violence.   All        defence withnesses have given evidence, but the majority  of prosecution witnesses failed to appear.  AI is urging  that the charges against these men be dropped as no       evidence has been presented against them.
