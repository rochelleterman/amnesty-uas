 Uganda: Further information on Fear for safety/Fear of torture or ill-treatment/possible extrajudicial execution, twenty prisoners in Northern Uganda. | Amnesty International 
 21 Members of the Uganda Young Democrats remain in detention on charges of treason, but the authorities have now granted them access to their relatives and lawyers. They claim that they were tortured by security agents. Two other prisoners, Alex Otim and Joseph Odong were released and charges against them were dropped, however, they remain at risk of being rearrested by security agents. The High Court of Uganda has ordered that the body of Peter Oloya, who was reportedly shot in Gulu Central Prison should released to his family for burial. However, this order has not yet been implemented.
