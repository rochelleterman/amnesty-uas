 Honduras: Journalists killed in Honduras | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Journalists in Honduras are at serious risk. Six journalists, all men, have been shot dead in the last eight weeks, and numerous others have received death threats. No one has been held to account and no action taken to support and protect journalists who write or speak out about organized crime, human rights violations or the government. "
