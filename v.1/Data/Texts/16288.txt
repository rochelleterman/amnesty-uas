 Uzbekistan: Further information on fear of imminent execution: Rinat Nazipov | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Clemency Commission of Uzbekistan has turned down Rinat Nazipov's petition for clemency, his only hope of avoiding execution. He was last seen alive on 7 June 1995, when his parents visited him on death row in Tashkent. Since then they have not been granted another visit and they fear that his death may be imminent. AI is calling on the President of Uzbekistan to commute the death sentence."
