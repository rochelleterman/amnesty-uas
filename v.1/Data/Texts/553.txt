 Chad: Fear of extrajudicial executions | Amnesty International 
 Georges Toubade, Karbida Nerobe and four unidentified men: Amnesty International is extremely concerned at an order, signed by Chad's Director General of the National Gendarmerie, which instructs all members of the Gendarmerie to extrajudicially execute criminals caught in the act. On 12 November in N'Djamena, Georges Toubade and Karbida Nerobe, were arrested on suspicion of theft. They are reported to have been beaten at the Dembe gendarmerie station before being shot on the same day. On 3 December the bodies of four unidentified men, bearing traces of torture, were found near the village of Djalali Arabe. Other extrajudicial executions have also been reported. Amnesty International is demanding the withdrawal of this order.
