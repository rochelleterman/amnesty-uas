 NA 
 Muhammad al-Nubani, a 27-year-old Palestinian from the village of Mazari' al-Nubani near Ramallah on the West Bank, was arrested by Israeli forces in the town of Bir Zeit on 22 April 1993. During his arrest he was allegedly kicked and beaten, until he started bleeding from his head, nose and mouth. On being taken to Ramallah prison, he spent five minutes with a doctor who merely cleaned the blood from his face and body. He did not see a lawyer until 20 May, and in an affidavit to his lawyer, he claims he was tortured during interrogation. He is still being held in detention without trial, and he is said to suffer from severe back pain, headaches, stomach pain, and shortness of breath. "
