 USA (North Carolina): Death penalty / Legal concern - Edward Ernest Hartman (m), white,    aged 39 | Amnesty International 
 Eddie Hartman is scheduled to be executed in North Carolina on 3 October. He was sentenced to death in October 1994 for the robbery and murder of Herman Smith. Eddie Hartman was arrested and voluntarily confessed to the shooting. There is deep concern that the prosecution used Eddie Hartman?s homosexuality against him at the trial as part of its successful bid to obtain a death sentence.
