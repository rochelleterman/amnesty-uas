 AI fears that the two men named above may be tortured in military custody. They were arrested on 30 June 1995 in Dili, East Timor, apparently on suspicion of involvement in pro-independence activities. They are apparently held in the headquarters of the military intelligence unit of the Sub-Regional Military Command for East Timor, in Dili. There have been frequent reports of torture of prisoners in SGI detention."
