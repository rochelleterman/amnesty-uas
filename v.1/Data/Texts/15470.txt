 United Kingdom: Cruel, inhuman and degrading          treatment/Medical concern: Algerian former torture victim, known as   ""G"" | Amnesty International 
 The UK authorities have prevented the release of an Algerian man, certified as a ""suspected international terrorist"" by the Home Secretary, who was granted bail by the tribunal empowered to review such cases. Amnesty International believes he is held in cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions in violation of international law, including the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
