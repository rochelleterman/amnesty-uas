 Burundi: Ill-treatment / fear for safety / possible prisoner of conscience: Laurence Rusuku (f) | Amnesty International 
 The above, a 35-year-old teacher at Rutegama secondary school in Muramvya, is reported to have been beaten in custody and is being held incommunicado. Amnesty International believes Laurence Rusuku may be a prisoner of conscience detained solely on account of her being the wife of Basile Ntamazeze, who was the head of the local branch of the former ruling party Front for Democracy in Burundi.
