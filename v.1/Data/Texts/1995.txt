 All seven people named above have now been released from detention. All but Ernest Allen were released on 1 April. He was transferred to the Central Prison, Pademba Road, Freetown, where he remained without charge or trial until 9 July when he was among 86 political detainees released from Pademba Road prison. The government had claimed that he had been involved in a conspiracy to purchase arms and missiles from Ukraine, but was released because of lack of evidence. He has however been dismissed from his post at the Department of Defence. "
