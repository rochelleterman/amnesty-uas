 Uzbekistan: Further information on Death Penalty / possible imminent execution 

 | Amnesty International 
 On 20 December 1999, the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan      turned down Arsen Arutyunyan and Danis Sirazhev's appeal  against their death sentences. Although they will now     appeal to the Presidium of the Supreme Court of           Uzbekistan, Amnesty International is concerned that this  could mean that their execution will take place very      soon.
