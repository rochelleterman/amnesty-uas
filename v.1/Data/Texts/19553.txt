 Oliver Igwe, the 77-year-old father of Nigerian human rights defender Leo Igwe, was attacked in his home by unidentified men, causing him to lose an eye. The police have refused to investigate the incident, which is believed to be linked to the Igwe familyâ€™s campaign for justice for a rape survivor. The family is at risk of further reprisals if the authorities do not protect them."
