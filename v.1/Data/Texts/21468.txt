 Makhmadsalors Delilovich Masaev was abducted on 3 August 2008 in Grozny, capital of the Chechen Republic, by men in camouflage uniform. He was in Grozny to attend the funeral of a relative and, on 3 August, he decided to visit other relatives in the nearby town of Sernovodsk. When he did arrive, his relatives started to search for him and found that he had been seen being taken away in Grozny. There are grounds to believe that he was detained by Chechen law enforcement officials."
