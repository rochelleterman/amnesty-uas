 Honduras: Fear for safety/death threats | Amnesty International 
 Jos_ Idalecio Murillo, one of the leaders of an umbrella group of Honduran human rights, environmental and other grassroots organizations has received death threats, and gunmen have fired at his house. One of the member organizations has also received death threats. All this is apparently retribution for the group's recent campaign against illegal logging in environmentally protected areas and local government corruption.
