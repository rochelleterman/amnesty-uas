 On 31 January 1995 the procuracy concluded its summary at the trial of a group of men facing charges ranging from illegal arms possession to murder and terrorism. The procuracy called for the death penalty for Irakli Dokvadze and Petre Gelbakhiani. Recommended sentences for the others ranged from 3 to 15 years' imprisonment. Charges against Omari Kochlamazashvili and Zurab Bardzhimashvili were removed from the case. In addition to the death penalty, AI is concerned about allegations that trial proceeding have not conformed to internationally accepted standards for fair trial. AI is also concerned about alleged torture in pre-trial detention and poor prison conditions."
