 Former Guantænamo detainee Rasul Kudaev, age 29, who has been held since 2005 at a pre-trial detention centre (SIZO) in the city of Nalchik in the Russian Republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, may have hepatitis and says he is not receiving any medical treatment. He has recently begun a hunger strike, which has exacerbated concerns for his deteriorating health.
