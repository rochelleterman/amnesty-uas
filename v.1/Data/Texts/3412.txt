 UA 351/93 - Zaire: fear of extrajudicial execution: Felix Mbayi Kalombo, Lambert Tshitshimbi Katombe | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 19 September 1993 Felix Mbayi Kalombo was shot in the leg when several bullets were fired into his house in Kinshasa. His attackers are believed to have been members of the security forces. There have been unconfirmed reports that security agents have been attempting to kill him in hospital where he is undergoing treatment. Lambert Tshitshimbi Katombe is apparently in hiding. The two men were arrested earlier this year, but were recently released from custody after being granted provisional release. "
