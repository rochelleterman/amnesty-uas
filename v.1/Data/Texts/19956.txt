 Colombia: Fear for Safety/Death threats | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of the six men named in the action, following an ongoing campaign of intimidation by paramilitary groups. On 18 September 2008, the Oil Workers’ Trade Union received a death threat via e-mail from the paramilitary group, The Carlos Castaño is Still Alive Eagles. The email also accused the six men of making up the political wing of the National Liberation Army."
