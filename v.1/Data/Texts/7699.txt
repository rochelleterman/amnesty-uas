 Panama: Fear of refoulement / fear for safety: Refugee peasant farmers from the Uraba region of Colombia | Amnesty International 
 Over 200 Colombian refugees who in recent days have fled an upsurge in violence in the Colombian border province of Choco, are at risk of forcible return by the Panamanian authorities to Colombia, where they would be at serious risk. The refugees are living in temporary camps near the village of Boca de Cupe, Yape. Amnesty International is calling on the authorities to abide by their obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and to ensure the safety and well-being of the refugees.
