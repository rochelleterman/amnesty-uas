 UA 328/92 - South Africa: fear of extrajudicial execution: Siza Rani | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Siza Rani, chairperson of the Sharpeville township branch of the ANC, appears to be the target of systematic harassment by members of the South African Police based in the Vaal Triangle area of South Johannesburg. He and his family have been forced to go into hiding, following renewed police raids on his home. Ten months ago, in December 1991, police forcibly entered his home and searched it, virtually ransacking the house in the process. To AI's knowledge no progress has been made in investigations into the December 1991 incident. The police have not revealed the reasons for these latest raids on Siza Rani's house. "
