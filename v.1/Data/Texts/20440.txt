 Peru: Fear for safety: Techi (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Transgender woman Techi was kidnapped and tortured by members of a local neighbourhood watch patrol in the town of Tarapoto in San Martín Province, northern Peru, on 24 January 2009 and told that “this is being done to you because you had sex with a homosexual”.  Amnesty International is deeply concerned at the attack on Techi and fears for her continued safety and that of other transgender people in the town."
