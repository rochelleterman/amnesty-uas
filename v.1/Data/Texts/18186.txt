 Three men have been sentenced to death after an unfair trial. If the sentence is ratified by President Yasser Arafat, they could be executed any time. Husayn Abu al-Uyun was shot dead by armed Palestinians, not affiliated with the Palestinian Security Forces, in Nablus on 15 March. He had escaped from Nablus prison on 9 March, after the gates of the complex were damaged by Israeli helicopter gunfire.
