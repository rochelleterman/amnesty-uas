 UA 81/93 - Greece: fear of ill-treatment / legal concern: Charalambos (Babis) Andreopoulos | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned that the military authorities in Greece may be about to imprison Charalambos Andreopoulos, a recognized minister of the Jehovah's Witness faith, for abiding by his religion's conscientious objection to military service. The authorities are threatening to flout the automatic exemption from compulsory military service for religious ministers introduced in 1988. If imprisoned, AI will consider Charalambos Andreopoulos to be a prisoner of conscience. AI is also concerned that he could be held in harsh conditions in the disciplinary cell at Nigrita, Serres, where he has been called up. "
