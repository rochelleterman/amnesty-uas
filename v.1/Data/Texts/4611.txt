 UA 126/93 - Colombia: death threats: Eduardo Umana Mendoza | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Human rights lawyer Dr Eduardo Umana Mendoza has recently received anonymous telephone calls threatening to kill him if he does not cease his human rights activities. He has been repeatedly threatened in the past as a result of his work on human rights cases, particularly those involving members of the security forces under investigation for alleged human rights violations. These recent threats are believed to be related to his work on the case of telecommunications technicians charged with offences under anti-terrorist legislation. "
