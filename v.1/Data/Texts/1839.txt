 Rwanda: ""Disappearance"" / Fear for safety / health concern: Ignace Kanyabugoyi | Amnesty International 
 Recent reports suggest that Ignace Kanyabugoyi, who       ""disappeared"" in August 1998, is being detained at a      psychiatric institution where it is claimed he has        suffered a ""psychological breakdown"". The authorities     have not acknowledged his presence there, however, and    have denied his relatives permission to see him.  Amnesty International is very concerned for his safety and        well-being.
