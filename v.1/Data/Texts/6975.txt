 UA 289/92 - Haiti: possible extrajudicial execution: Marcel Fleurzile | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The body of Marcel Fleurzile, a peasant leader and member of the Comite National des Congres des Mouvements Democratiques (KONAKOM), was found near the KONAKOM offices in Port-au-Prince on 3 September 1992. He had been shot several times. AI is concerned that he may have been targeted by the authorities because of his peasant leadership and membership of KONAKOM. Following the coup of September 1991, Marcel Fleurzile had reportedly been harassed continuously by the local authorities, apparently because of his support for ousted President Aristide. "
