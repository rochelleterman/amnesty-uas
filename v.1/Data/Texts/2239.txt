 AI is concerned that security personnel responding to violent protests in several prisons have resorted to arbitrary or abusive of force, resulting in scores of injuries. Disturbances broke out at Pollsmoor and Boksburg prisons on 18 March following an announcement that certain categories of prisoners would not be allowed to vote in the all-race elections. Human rights workers and relatives and families remain concerned that prisoners are not being given adequate medical care."
