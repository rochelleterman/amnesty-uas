 AI fears that three young men arrested in Yangon on 18 November may be facing ill-treatment of torture in detention and may have been arrested solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression or association. The three were arrested after a meeting outside the house of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and were reportedly tried on 20 November but the outcome of the trial is not known."
