 There is concern that the above men, some of whom may be prisoners of conscience, are not receiving a fair trial on terrorist charges, in Tiraspol, capital of the self-proclaimed Dnestr Moldovan Republic (DMR). The six men are all members of the Christian-Democratic Popular Front, which supports the unification of the former Soviet republic of Moldova with Romania. There have been allegations of torture and ill-treatment to obtain confessions. Lawyers for four of the men withdrew on 5 May, when the court refused a request to hospitalize Andrei Ivantoc, who is said to suffer from a serious liver disease. The proceedings, which have been adjourned twice, are due to open again on 24 May and the men face a possible death sentence if convicted. "
