 Mexico: Death threats / fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Pilar Noriega (f), lawyer and Digna Ochoa (f), lawyer: On 10 August 1996 the above received death threats in two communications left in PRODH's offices. The threats follow systematic harassment and threats against other PRODH members in recent months, apparently with the aim of undermining the Centre's efforts to defend human rights. The threats are believed to be a result of the lawyers' work for a group of detainees accused of being members of an armed opposition group.
