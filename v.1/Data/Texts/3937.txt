 Brazil: Further information on: fear for safety/forced eviction, Members of Guarani indigenous communities in Mato Grosso do Sul state | Amnesty International 
 On 14 September, the Federal Appeals Court (Superior Tribunal de Justiàa), turned down a challenge by landowners which disputed the Brazilian government's identification of the 9000 hectare Yvy Katu indigenous territory, home to some 3000 Guarani Indians, as an indigenous area. As a result the community are no longer facing any imminent threat of violent eviction. However the process for demarcation of indigenous land is slow and it is possible that further judicial challenges might be raised in an attempt to block the Indians from becoming rightful occupants of their ancestral land.
