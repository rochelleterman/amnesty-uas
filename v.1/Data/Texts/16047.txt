 Kyrgyzstan: Fear of Forcible Return/Fear of Torture		


 | Amnesty International 
 Four refugees from Uzbekistan (Zhakhongir Maksudov, Odilzhon Rakhimov, Yakub Toshboev and Rasulzhon Pirmatov) who have been in detention in Kyrgyzstan since June 2005, are believed to be in imminent danger of being forcibly returned to Uzbekistan. Amnesty International is concerned that, if returned, the men are at risk of serious human rights violations.
