 Cuba: Harassment: Edgard Lopez Moreno (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Edgard López Moreno, who was accepted as a refugee by the US government in February 2007, has been repeatedly denied an exit visa by the Cuban authorities. He has been on hunger strike in protest, since 14 April. His wife was accepted as a refugee at the same time as Edgard, and was given an exit visa in 2007; she now lives in the US, as do Edgard's brothers and other relatives. Edgard believes he is being treated like this because of his work as president of Coalición Juvenil Martiana (Marti’s Youth Coalition), a pro-democracy organization he co-founded in 2005."
