 Tunisia: Further information on prisoner of conscience / fear of ill-treatment and new concern: torture / medical concern: Abdel Moumen Belanes | Amnesty International 
 Abdel Moumen Belanes has been on hunger-strike since 8 December and was so weak that he had difficulty standing when he was brought before the Tunis appeal court on 17 December 1997. AI is concerned for his health and fears that he may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment.
