 The ethnic Albanians form Kosovo province named above have allegedly been subjected to torture and ill-treatment in detention. As a result, some of them have made statements incriminating themselves or others. AI fears that they may be subjected to more torture or ill-treatment to extract more confessions or to attempt to stop them retracting statements they have already made. They are detained pending trial or following conviction on charges of conspiring to undermine, by violent means, Yugoslavia's territorial integrity."
