 Syria: Fear of torture or ill-treatment: Mahmoud Simmak   (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has learnt that Mahmoud Simmak, teacher, a 65-year-old Syrian national who lives in Yemen, was arrested in April by the Syrian authorities when he arrived in the Syrian capital Damascus to visit his family, whom he has not seen for five years. He has lived in exile in Yemen for over 20 years after being accused of belonging to the outlawed organization, the Muslim Brotherhood. He has recently been transferred to the Palestine Branch of Military Intelligence detention centre in Damascus, prompting concern that he may be in danger of torture and ill-treatment.
