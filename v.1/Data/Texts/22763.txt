 Syrian civil society activist Amjad Baiazy has been held incommunicado since his arrest at Syriaâ€™s Damascus International Airport on 12 May. Amnesty International believes that he may be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression. He is at serious risk of torture and other ill-treatment. "
