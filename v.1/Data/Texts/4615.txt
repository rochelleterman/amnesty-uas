 Colombia: Possible ""disappearance"" / fear for safety: Ramon Alberto Osorio Beltran | Amnesty International 
 There is very grave concern for the safety of trade union leader Ramon Alberto Osorio Beltran who was reportedly abducted by armed men on 15 April 1997. Ramon Osorio is a leader of the Agricultural Workers Trade Union (SINTRAINAGRO) and a member of the Colombian Communist Party (PCC). In January 1997 he had been arrested by the security forces, together with four other people, Martha Zapata, Ana Rengifo, Gerardo Nieto and Eugenio Cordoba. All five were released on 5 February, but since Ramon Osorio's ""disappearance"" there are also fears for their safety.
