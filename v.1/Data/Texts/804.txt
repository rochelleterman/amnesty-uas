 Ethiopia:  Further information on incommunicado detention/ fear of torture or ill-treatment/ health concern 	 | Amnesty International 
 Bashir Ahmed Maktal is at risk of ill-treatment or torture, as the government suspect him of links with an armed opposition group which attacked an oilfield in the east of the country on 24 April. He is believed to be detained incommunicado at the police Central Investigation Bureau (known as Maikelawi) in the capital, Addis Ababa, and has not been charged with any offence.  The Ethiopian authorities have acknowledged detaining 41 of more than 80 people who were arrested trying to cross from Somalia into Kenya, and have said 29 will be released. The whereabouts of the remaining detainees remain unknown.
