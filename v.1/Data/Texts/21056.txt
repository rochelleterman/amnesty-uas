 Indonesia: Prisoner of conscience denied medical care: Johan Teterissa  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Indonesian prisoner of conscience Johan Teterissa is in urgent need of medical care. He has been seriously ill for the last two weeks, apparently as a result of a deterioration in his health after he was tortured and otherwise ill-treated when he was arrested in June 2007. He has been denied access to the treatment he needs by prison authorities. "
