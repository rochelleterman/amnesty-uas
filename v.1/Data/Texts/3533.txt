 Eleven former senior Eritrean government officials were arrested in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, on 18 and 19 September 2001. Their whereabouts are currently unknown and Amnesty International fears for their safety. Amnesty International considers that they   may be prisoners of   conscience detained solely for the    peaceful expression of their political concerns."
