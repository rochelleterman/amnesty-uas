 The 10 former communist party officials named above are currently on trial in Tirana, charged with granting themselves privileges from state funds, an offence punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment. AI is concerned that their right to a fair trial has been seriously undermined by the court's decision on 13 December to ban press reporting of the case. The organization fears that this precedent could undermine the rights of future defendants to a fair and open trial."
