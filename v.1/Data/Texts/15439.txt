 Turkey: Further information on death threats / fear for safety: Abdurrahman Mustak | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International continues to be gravely concerned for the safety of Abdurraham Mustak, headman of Yesilyurt village and other villagers from Yesilyurt village. Abdurrahman Mustak was subjected to death threats while in detention on 6 February 1996 and it is believed that the threats relate to a personal petition to the European Court of Human Rights against the Turkish government. Villagers of Yesilyurt have also been repeatedly arrested and put under pressure to join the government's militia system against the Kurdish Worker's Party.
