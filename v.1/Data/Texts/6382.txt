 Guatemala: Possible extrajudicial execution/ Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 The head of Guatemala's National Printing Office has fled the country to escape death threats, after she accused Vice President Juan Francisco Reyes of illegally ordering the Office to print leaflets attacking another official. Plant workers C_sar Posadas (m), Edgar L—pez (m) and Mario Castro (m), whose testimony supported her accusation have received death threats, and one (C_sar Augusto Rodas Furl‡n) has been murdered. Amnesty International believes that all those named above plus associated lawyers and investigators (Conchita Mazariegos (f), Alfonso Novales (m), Anabella de Le—n (f) and Magda Arceo) are in grave danger.
