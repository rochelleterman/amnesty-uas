 Syria / Romania: Fear of imminent refoulement and new concerns: ""disappearance"" / torture / medical concern / possible prisoner of conscience: Hussain Kamil | Amnesty International 
 Hussain Kamil, a 37-year-old asylum-seeker forcibly returned to Syria from Romania on 5 March 1996, has not been heard from since the end of May and is feared to have been arrested by the Syrian authorities. If this is the case, Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience and fears that he is at risk of torture.
