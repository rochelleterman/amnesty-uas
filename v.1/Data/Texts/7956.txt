 Peru: Prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 On 10 April, the Peruvian Supreme Court ordered the re-detention of the two former prisoners of consciences (Herminio Palomino Soto (m); Julia Natividad Rodrçguez Suærez (f)). They were in the past unfairly charged with ""terrorism"" related offences and should they be re-detained Amnesty International would once again consider them to be prisoners of conscience and call for their immediate and unconditional release.
