 Juan Fidel Zamudio Bocángel, who was tortured by police in 2005, was shot and seriously wounded on 12 June 2008. A police officer was imprisoned for the 2005 torture in February 2008, and Amnesty International believes it was because of this that Juan Zamudio Bocángel was shot. He and his family are in grave danger. His mother, Gisela Bocángel, has also received numerous death threats."
