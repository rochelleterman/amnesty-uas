 Uzbekistan: Further information on Fear of torture / Fear for safety, Yusuf      Dzhumaev, poet.


 | Amnesty International 
 A number of UA appeal writers have received a standard reply from the Uzbek authorities claiming that Yusuf Dzhumaev was detained because his poems called for a jihad against the government. Amnesty International believes this accusation is untrue, and Yusuf Dzhumaev has been detained solely to punish him for exercising his right to freedom of expression. According to unofficial sources, the Procurator General has asked for him to be released.
