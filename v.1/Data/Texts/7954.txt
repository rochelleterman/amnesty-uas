 Peru: Police Brutality/Excessive use of Force | Amnesty International 
 On 27 May, a thirty-day state of emergency was declared in Peru, under which certain Constitutional rights have been suspended. Amnesty International is concerned that this could result in the security forces using excessive force against demonstrators. The organization is also concerned that this might mark the beginning of further human rights violations.
