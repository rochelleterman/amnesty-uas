 The three men named above, members of the Capehan Farmers' Association (CFA) in Tuburan, Cebu, have been harassed and threatened with death by local government officials and police since April 1993. The threats are apparently intended to stop the farmers campaigning for government assistance and improvements to their land. The three farmers, and other members of the CFA, are frightened and believe their lives may be in danger. "
