 Police officers in the southern Mexican city of Mérida detained and tortured lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights activist José Ricardo Maldonado Arroyo in an attempt to extract information from him. They arbitrarily arrested him for around four hours and threatened him with reprisals if he spoke about the incident. There is grave concern for his safety."
