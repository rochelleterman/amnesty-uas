 Paraguay: Setback to community's land claim - further information | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The claim of Paraguay's Yakye Axa Indigenous community to the land which they have inhabited for generations has been rejected by a key commission in the country's Congress. On 25 June, a majority of the members of the Agrarian Reform Commission voted to reject a bill to return the contested land to the Yakye Axa. This vote undermines a binding decision made by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the highest inter-governmental body in the region."
