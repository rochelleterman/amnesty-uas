 USA : Further information on fear of indiscriminate mass killing of civilians in Iraq | Amnesty International 
 At least 39 civilians, including women and children, have reportedly been killed as a result of US and UK air       strikes since the beginning of April 1999, mostly within  the northern air exclusion zone. Scores have reportedly   been injured and several houses destroyed. AI remains     concerned that US and UK forces may have given            insufficient consideration to the proximity of civilians  to military targets, resulting in indiscriminate or       disproportionate impact on civilians.
