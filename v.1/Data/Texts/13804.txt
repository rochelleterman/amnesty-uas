 Solomon Islands: Fear for safety - Matthew Wale and       Julian Treadaway. | Amnesty International 
 Gunmen have threatened and attacked prominent citizens,   including Matthew Wale and Julian Treadaway,  who have    called for civil society to be      allowed to play a     role in the peace process now underway  in the Solomon     Islands' two-year ethnic conflict, and who have publicly  opposed a blanket amnesty for those    involved in the       conflict, which has left more than  100 people dead.
