 Recent reports in the Arabic press indicate that the Sudanses authorities have begun a crackdown on information coming into the country. This includes the confiscation of fax and telex machines through which people receive information which the government considers politically sensitive. In this wave of the crackdown, Ahmed Adballa Akood, a former ministry official, was reportedly arrested on 15 July 1995, apparently for owing a fax machine. He is now being held in Kober Prison, without charge. AI is calling on the Sudanese authorities to release him unless e is to be charged with a recognizably criminal ofence and brought promptly to a fair trial."
