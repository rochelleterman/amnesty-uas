 Georgia: Thousands forcibly evicted in Georgia | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned by a series of forced evictions of internally displaced people carried out by local authorities in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. According to sources in Georgia, around 5,000 people have been forcibly evicted from their homes since mid-June. Some of them have not been given any alternative housing, others were sent to homes that appear to be unsuitable for habitation. More forced evictions are likely to take place in the near future."
