 Kanwar Singh Dharmi and Kuldip Kaur remain detained in Chandigarh, Punjab under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA). They were remanded to judicial custody by a magistrate on 8 April 1994. Under the provisions of TADA they can remain in detention without charge or trial for a maximum period of one year. At present, Amnesty International does not have sufficient evidence to prove that the couple were detained for 10 months before their arrest in March 1994."
