 Muzaffar Mirzaev was executed in June 2003 despite allegations that he was mentally ill and an intervention by the United Nations Human Rights Committee two months earlier, urging the authorities to put his execution on hold. His mother had official permission to visit him in prison on 25 June, but was turned away by prison guards. Amnesty International believes that he had been secretly executed prior to her visit.
