"Cambodia: Prisoners of conscience/human rights defenders at risk 
 NA 
 The Cambodian authorities are cracking down on critics of the government, taking legal action against them that appears to be politically motivated. Kem Sokha (m), Yeng Virak (m), Pa Nguon Teang (m), Rong Chhun (m) and Mam Sonando (m) have been arrested and are facing trial on charges that carry sentences of up to five years' imprisonment. The authorities are seeking Chea Mony (m), Ea Channa (m), Men Nath (m), Prince Sisowath Thomico (m), and Say Bory (m). Other human rights defenders and perceived critics of the government are feared to be at risk of arrest.
