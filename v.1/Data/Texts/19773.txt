 The Egyptian authorities organised a mass forcible return of Eritreans from Egypt to Eritrea starting on 11 June 2008. Amnesty International believes that up to 820 asylum-seekers are now in Eritrea and are at grave risk of arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention, torture or other forms of ill-treatment."
