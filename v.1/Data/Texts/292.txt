 Juv?nal Niyonzima and Michel Manirambona have not been    seen since they were arrested on 26 September 1999,       reportedly by   soldiers on patrol. Amnesty International is especially   concerned for their safety following      reports that L?ovin  Nzeyimana, who ""disappeared"" after   soldiers arrested him  on 19 September, was               extrajudicially executed shortly     after his arrest and buried in a secret grave.
