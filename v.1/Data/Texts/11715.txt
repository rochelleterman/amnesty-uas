 Up to 22 individuals are believed to still be detained in Dili as a result of rioting which began on 8 September. AI's fears that those in detention are at serious risk of beatings and torture have been heightened by reports that some have already been severely beaten. AI has also received the names of 3 individuals alleged to have been shot in Dili since 8 September. Two of the three are alleged to have died as a result. AI cannot confirm these reports."
