 Jamaica: Further information on Forcible Return of Asylum Seekers, Six Haitian nationals | Amnesty International 
 The six Haitian nationals had their applications for asylum rejected by the Jamaican authorities on 7 December. They reportedly had no access to a full and fair refugee determination procedure. Amnesty International has longstanding concerns about human rights violations in Haiti, and fears their lives may be in danger if they are returned.
