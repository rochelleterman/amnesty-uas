 Croatia: Fear of refoulement / ill-treatment: Muslim refugees in Kuplensko | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned by continuing reports of refoulement of members of a group of more than 20,000 Muslim refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina who are in a collection centre around Kuplensko. Some have been ill-treated by the Croatian police. The Croatian authorities have refused to formally grant them refugee status and have made it clear that they want them to return as soon as possible. AI fears that the authorities will continue to forcibly return refugees and seek to pressure on them to return."
