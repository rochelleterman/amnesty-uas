 Walid Romdhani is detained incommunicado and believed to be held by the Department of State Security (DSS) in the Tunisian capital, Tunis, where he is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. His arrest is likely to be linked with his work on behalf of his brother, who has been detained, tortured and ill-treated by the Tunisian security forces."
