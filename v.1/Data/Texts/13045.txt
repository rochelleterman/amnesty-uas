 Chris Batan, a 26-year-old worker with Task Force Detainees of the Philippines and tribal activist, was shot dead on 23 February 1993 in barangay Betwagan, Sadanga, Mountain Province. He was on his way to investigate and document violations committed under the regime of former President Marcos. Witness have identified his killers as members of the government-backed militia CAFGU, used by the military in counter-insurgency operations. It is widely believed that he was killed because of his efforts to protect the human rights of local residents. "
