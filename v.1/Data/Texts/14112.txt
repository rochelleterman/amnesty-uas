 UA 125/93 - Romania: legal concern / fear of ill-treatment: Mirel Ciprian Cucu, Milorad Mutascu | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Mirel Ciprian Cucu, aged 17, and Milorad Mutascu, aged 22, were arrested on 22 January 1993 in Sinnicolau Mare and placed in preventive detention. Mirel Ciprian Cucu has been charged with having sexual relations with a person of the same sex, for which he could face up to 5 years in prison. He is now free pending trial. Milorad Mutascu is in preventive detention awaiting trial, charged with having homosexual relations with a minor, which carries a sentence of up to 7 years. AI is concerned that both have been arrested and charged solely because of their consensual homosexual relationship. AI has adopted Milorad Mutascu as a prisoner of conscience; should Mirel Ciprian Cucu be imprisoned, AI will consider him also to be a prisoner of conscience. "
