 NA 
 Khin Zaw Win has not been seen since 4 July 1994 when he was reportedly arrested by members of Military Branch Three at Yangon (Rangoon) airport as he tried to board a plane to Singapore. Khin Zaw Win, a student known to have close links with political opposition groups in Myanmar, had been studying in Singapore on a Singapore government scholarship. There are fears that he may be tortured in incommunicado detention."
