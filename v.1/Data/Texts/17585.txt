 Iraq: Fear of imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 According to the Iraqi news agency Aswat al-Iraq 11 people are facing imminent execution. The Court of Cassation has upheld their death sentences, which will now be passed to the Presidential Council for ratification. Their only hope now is for the Presidential Council to refuse to ratify their sentences, or for the president to pardon them.
