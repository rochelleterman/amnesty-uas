 Cuba: Possible prisoners of conscience/legal concern | Amnesty International 
 Renâ G¢mez Manzano, Oscar Mario GonzÊlez and Julio Câsar L¢pez RodrÁguez were detained in the capital Havana after participating in a peaceful demonstration against the Cuban government on 22 July. They could face up to 20 years in prison. Three other men arrested at the demonstration remain in detention, along with six men detained on 13 July during another peaceful event in Havana. Amnesty International believes that all fifteen men may be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression, association and assembly.
