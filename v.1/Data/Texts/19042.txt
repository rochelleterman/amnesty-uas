 UA 186/93 - Tunisia: health concern / wrongful detention: Naoufel Ziadi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Naoufel Ziadi, General Secretary of the Tunisian Students' Union, has been wrongfully detained since 18 May 1993. AI believes him to be a prisoner of conscience. He was arrested after having been sentenced in absentia to two years' imprisonment on drugs charges: however, the accusations against him were withdrawn and there is no other evidence against him. AI is particularly concerned about his health: he has a serious heart condition and also needs medicaltion for kidney problems."
