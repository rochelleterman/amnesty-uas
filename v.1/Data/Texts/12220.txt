 NA 
 On 7 June 1994 the Supreme Court rejected the appeal of Mokhtar Hassan, a taxi driver in Kuala Lumpur. He had been sentenced to death on 9 March 1992 for drug trafficking. His only hope for a pardon or commutation now resides with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia and Supreme Head of State)."
