 The above-named Assyrian Christian peasants from the village of Zaz, near Midyat, Mardin province, were detained on 19 January 1993, reportedly following information given against them during the interrogation of an alleged guerrilla. They are currently in custody in Midyat but it is feared that they might soon be taken to Mardin Gendarmerie and interrogated under torture in incommunicado detention. "
