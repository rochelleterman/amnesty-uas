 Human rights activists, journalists and others have been detained by the Egyptian security forces in an apparent crackdown on independent reporting of the unrest in Egypt. Two Amnesty International staff members and a delegate from Human Rights Watch are among those detained. They are currently being detained in an unknown location. Amnesty International fears that all those detained may be at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. "
