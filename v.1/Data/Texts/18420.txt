 Saudi Arabia: Fear of torture or ill treatment/incommunicado detention/possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Eight women (Lulowa al-Dir'i, Hila al-Husni, Lulowa al-Husni, Um 'Abdel Rahman al 'Awda, Zainab al-Mikhlif,   Khowla al-Mikhlif, Hila Ibrahim, Tarfa Ibrahim), all      relatives of political prisoners, were arrested on 2      September 2007 in Buraida in the al-Qassim region, north  of the capital, Riyadh. According to reports, the women   are being held incommunicado and may be at risk of        torture or other ill-treatment. Amnesty International     believes that they may have been detained solely for the  non-violent expression of their beliefs, and if so, would consider them to be prisoners of conscience.
