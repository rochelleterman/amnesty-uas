 USA (North Carolina): Death penalty / Legal concern : Charles Anthony Walker | Amnesty International 
 Charles Walker is scheduled to be executed in North Carolina on 3 December 2004. He was convicted in 1995 of the first degree murder of Tito Davidson in 1992. Charles Walker, who has a history of mental illness, was convicted on the basis of testimony of accomplices, none of whom was subjected to a capital trial. The jury which sentenced him to death did so despite finding that he had not actually killed Tito Davidson, whose body was never found. Several of the jurors now support clemency.
