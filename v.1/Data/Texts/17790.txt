 The population of the Gaza Strip - 1.5 million Palestinians - has been unable to leave the Gaza Strip since 9 June 2007, when Israel closed the Rafah Crossing between Gaza and Egypt, the only gate to the outside world. Those affected include patients in need of medical treatment which is not available in Gaza's hospitals.  A growing number of patients are missing potentially life-saving medical treatment abroad.
