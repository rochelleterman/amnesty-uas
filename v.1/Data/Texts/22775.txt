 NA 
 Hundreds of people arrested during protests in Syria have now been released, some individually in previous months and some following a “general amnesty” on 31 May 2011. Nonetheless, arrests continue on a daily basis and hundreds of people remain in incommunicado detention, where they are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. "
