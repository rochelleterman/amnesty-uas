 Canada: Possible Prisoner of Conscience: Jeremy Hinzman (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 23 September, the Canadian authorities intend to deport US serviceman Jeremy Hinzman, his wife, son and one-month-old daughter. Jeremy Hinzman fled to Canada to avoid being sent to Iraq because of his conscientious objection to the war there. If they deport him, he risks being court-martialled and jailed for between one and five years. If convicted, Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience."
