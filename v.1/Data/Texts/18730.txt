 Syria: Fear of Torture | Amnesty International 
 The three young women (Heba al-Khaled, Rola al-Khaled, Nadia al-Satour) are being held hostage by the authorities to put pressure on their husbands to give themselves up. They are held incommunicado, in solitary confinement in the tiny, filthy, underground cells at the Military Intelligence Palestine Branch in Damascus, where they are at risk of torture and further ill-treatment. Two of them are pregnant, and the other has her young baby with her.
