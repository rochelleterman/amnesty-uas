 On 2 September 1995 security officials raided a house at al-Thawra, a suburb of Omdurman, arresting the above 22 men. The authorities acknowledged their detentions on 12 September by announcing that a number of ""communists"" had been arrested at an illegal meeting.  They did not, however, give any indication of how many people had been detained or why they were being held.  AI believes that the men, who reman in incommunicado detention without charge or trial, may have been arrested for non-violent political opposition to the government and are at risk of torture."
