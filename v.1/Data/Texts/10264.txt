 NA 
 There is grave concern for the safety of thousands of ethnic Karen refugees fleeing a Burmese army offensive against the insurgent Karen National Union. They have been fleeing from villages in Tanintharyi (Tennasserim) Division to villages in Thailand, and there is concern that some have been refused permission to cross the border, and that others have repatriated to Myanmar, where they are at risk of ill-treatment, being taken as porters, or possible unlawful killing by the Burmese army.
