 Ethiopia: Further information on Medical concern / Torture / Detention without charge, Imiru Gurmessa Birru | Amnesty International 
 Imiru Gurmessa Birru was reportedly taken from hospital to a police investigation unit on a stretcher on 6 August. He is extremely ill, but is being denied the medication prescribed by hospital doctors. He is held incommunicado, which puts him at serious risk of torture. It is still not known exactly why he was arrested, and he has not been formally charged.
