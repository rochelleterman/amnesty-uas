 Ethiopia: Medical concern/ Prisoner of Conscience: Professor Mesfin Woldemariam (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Prisoner of conscience Professor Mesfin Woldemariam, aged 76, is receiving treatment in Addis Ababa's Police Hospital after collapsing in his prison cell on 18 August. He is reportedly suffering with pneumonia, which is likely to have been caused by the harsh conditions in which he has been held. Amnesty International is concerned that he may be returned to Kaliti Prison in Addis Ababa without receiving all the medical treatment that he needs.
