 USA (Tennessee): Further information on death penalty / legal concern: Robert Glen Coe | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 4 April 2000 a three-judge panel of the Sixth Circuit  Court of Appeals stopped Robert Coe's execution 15 hours  before it was due at 1am local time. The court said that  it wanted to review Tennessee's procedures for            determining mental competency for execution.  It is not   clear how quickly the court will conduct its review and   issue a ruling though it has ordered the lawyers to file  their legal papers by 6 April and promised an ""expedited  review"". There is therefore the possibility that if their decision goes against him, Robert Coe could be            rescheduled early next week to become the first prisoner  to be executed in Tennessee since 1960.
