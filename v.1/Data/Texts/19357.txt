 Yemen: Incommunicado detention/Fear of torture/Medical concern | Amnesty International 
 Scores of people, including Brigadier Nasser al-Nouba and Shallal Ali Shaya', were reportedly arrested on 2 August after a sit-in protest in Liberty Square, in central Aden, staged by retired soldiers. All are reportedly held incommunicado, and they are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. The security forces dispersed the protestors using teargas, water cannons, as well as live ammunition. Several were reportedly injured, and one protestor is feared to have been killed. Amnesty International is concerned that this may have resulted from an excessive use of force.
