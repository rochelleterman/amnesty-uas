 The above-mentioned people were sentenced to death on 24 April 1993 for attempting to overthrow the government on 26 September 1992. AI is concerned that they may have no right of appeal to a higher court and may face imminent execution. AI is also concerned about aspects of the trial which appears to have been unfair. "
