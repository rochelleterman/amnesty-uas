 Algeria: Death penalty / legal concern: Hamid Mebarki | Amnesty International 
 This prison guard was sentenced to death by a court in Algiers on 14 January 1998 on charges of involvement in a mutiny in Serkadji prison in Algiers in February 1995. He was convicted of taking part in murder, illegal detention of people, causing damage to property and smuggling arms to the detainees. Eight other men were sentenced to death in absentia on charges of having provided weapons and logistical support from the outside. Thirty-eight detainees were also tried in the same trial: nine were sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, two to eight years and 10 to between two and five years. AI is concerned that the trial did not comply with international standards of fairness. Hamid Mebarki may now seek a review by ""cassation"" by the Supreme Court.
