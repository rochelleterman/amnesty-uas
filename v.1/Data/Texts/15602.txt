 Russian Federation (Chechen Republic): Further information on fear for safety: Civilians in Grozny | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is highly alarmed at the threat of an all-out attack, scheduled for 22 August 1996, on the city of Grozny, and fears for the safety of the civilians who remain in the city. Russia's acting commander in Chechnya, General Pulikovsky, gave civilians 48 hours to leave the city, but AI is gravely concerned at reports that many people are unable to leave the city, because some routes are blocked by Russian forces.
