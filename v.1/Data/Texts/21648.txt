 Prisoner of conscience Azimzhan Askarov is critically ill and needs urgent specialized medical intervention.  At the start of the final session of his appeal on 10 November, his lawyer asked the appeal court judge to allow his client to be seen immediately by a specialist surgeon. No surgeon had been called by the end of the session and his family and colleagues fear for his life."
