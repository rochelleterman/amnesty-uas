 Hamma Hammami, a prisoner of conscience imprisoned since his arrest on 14 February 1994, has had both of his custodial sentences reduced by six months on appeal. At the appeal hearing in Gabes on 20 June both Hamma Hammami and his lawyers were prevented from freely presenting the case for his defence. Amnesty International is calling for his immediate and unconditional release as a prisoner of conscience."
