 Algeria:  Further information on arrests / prosecution / police intimidation /  fear for safety / fear of further detentions  of the relatives of the ""disappeared"" | Amnesty International 
 On 24 March 2000 Fatima ?Ime was released from police     detention and allowed to return home.  On 25 March Fatima Ben Mousa (f),     Rahmouna Bourahla (f), Faouzia Guene   (f) and Badra Leban  (f) were charged with participating  in  an unauthorised gathering in a public place and       released  on bail pending trial on 21 May. They were told by the    authorities that if they take part in any more            demonstrations they will be imprisoned. This    same warning has apparently been issued to other families of the       ""disappeared"". In addition the parents of    some of the     women who have taken part in such         demonstrations have     been told by the local            authorities that the participation of their daughters in  such public activities bring shame  on their families and on the reputation of Algeria.
