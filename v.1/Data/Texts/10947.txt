 On 10 August 1995 the Chinese authorities announced that they had executed at least ten people in Beijing to ensure ""public order"" during the Fourth UN World Conference on Women due to convene there in a few weeks. The Beijing Daily reported that among those executed were a group of four workers and peasants who committed murder during the robbery of six taxis and an unemployed man who led a gang of ten people in a revenge attack on a restaurant, killing the owner and injuring another. The rest were executed for crimes such as robbery, illegal sale of guns and ""hooliganism"". There are fears that these executions may be only the first of an execution campaign."
