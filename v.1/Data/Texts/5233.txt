 Colombia: Further information on Fear for Safety

 | Amnesty International 
 Army-backed paramilitaries have entered the hamlet of La Uni—n and forcibly rounded up members of the Peace Community of San Jos_ de Apartad—. At the site of a previous massacre, in the centre of the hamlet, they threatened to kill the villagers who refuse to collaborate with them, if they do not leave the area. A boy who tried to escape after being dragged from his home was killed. Despite repeated warnings of an impending attack, the government has failed to take effective action.
