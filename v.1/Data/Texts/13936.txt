 Rabah Hamana, Nassima Hamana and child: The above named and their newborn child face imminent and forcible return to Algeria where they would be at risk of serious human rights violations. The family have been summoned to appear at a police station on 31 January 1997, signalling the beginning of the procedure for their deportation. The Board of Refugees is considering reopening their case, but they must leave the country while their case is being reconsidered, and they could be sent back at any time to Algeria.
