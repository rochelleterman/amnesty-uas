 Judgement has been postponed on Chakufwa Chihana's appeal against his prison sentence for ""sedition"", probably until the end of March 1993 at least. The appeal hearing took place on 8 March 1993. At least five people were injured when the police used tear gas and fired on demonstrators outside the court. Members of the Malawi Young Pioneers reportedly attacked a librarian and students reading in Blantyre Polytechnic's library the day after the appeal hearing, claiming that they had participated in the previous day's demonstration. AI considers Chakufwa Chihana to be a prisoner of conscience. "
