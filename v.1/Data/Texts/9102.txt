"USA (Nebraska): Death penalty: John Joubert 
 USA (Nebraska): Death penalty: John Joubert | Amnesty International 
 The above, a white man, is scheduled to be executed in Nebraska on 28 June. He was sentenced to death in 1984 convicted of murder. Joubert has been previously scheduled for execution in 1988, 1990 and 1991: all three dates were stayed by appeal courts. The present Attorney General, Don Stenberg, said during a recent press conference that justice had been long delayed in this case and that it would be done soon. AI believes that these comments indicate that he has already decided against granting clemency before the petition has been presented by Joubert's attorneys.
