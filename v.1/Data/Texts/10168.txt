 Venezuela: Torture / fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Jesus Salvador Arrieta, aged 58, Jonathan Sojo, Miguel Del Duca, Jose Saavedra, Araciel Gonzalez: Four of the above five people are reported to have been tortured in detention, after being rounded up in the aftermath of protests at new economic measures announced by the government. There is concern that they may now face reprisals at the hands of those they denounced as having carried out the torture. Jose Saavedra is reportedly being held incommunicado. Jesus Salvador Arrieta was arrested at his home when members of the Cuerpo Tecnico de la Policia Judicial (CPTJ) could not locate his son Franklin Arrieta.
