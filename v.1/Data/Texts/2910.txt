 Sudan: Torture and ill-treatment/incommunicado detention/ possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Four men, Sati' Mohamed Al-Hajj (m), human rights lawyer; Yusuf Hussein (m); Tariq Ahmed Gasim (m) aged 21; and Fawaz Salah Al-Sayed (m), aged 21, are being held incommunicado by the security forces and are at risk of torture and ill-treatment. They were allegedly detained because they planned to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the summary execution of relatives. They appear to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for exercising their right to non-violent freedom of expression and association.
