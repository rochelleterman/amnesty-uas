 Mexico: Fear for safety / arbitrary detention | Amnesty International 
 A warrant has reportedly been issued for the arrest of    human rights lawyer Israel Ochoa Lara. Amnesty            International is concerned that were he to be detained    his safety could be in jeopardy. The organisation also    believes the order to detain Israel Ochoa could be        politically motivated, and in the event of his detention  would consider him to be a possible prisoner of           conscience.
