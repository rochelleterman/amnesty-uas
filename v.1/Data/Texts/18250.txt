 Palestinian Authority: Unlawful Killing/ Fear for safety/ Arbitrary detention/ Fear of ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 The unwarranted use of lethal force by police under the control of the Hamas de-facto administration in the Gaza Strip on 12 November 2007 resulted in the unlawful killing of at least six demonstrators and bystanders, including a child and an elderly man, and the injury of scores of others, including several children. The detention of a large number of political opponents by the same forces raises grave concern that there may be a renewed escalation of political violence that further threatens the safety of the civilian population.
