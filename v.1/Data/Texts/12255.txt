 Ibrahim Mohamad, Sabri Abdul Rani, Nasiruddin Ali, Fakhruddin Al-Razi Abdullah: Special Branch police officers arrested four former members of the Al Arqam Islamic Sufi sect at their homes in Kuala Lumpur and detained them without charge under the Internal Security Act. The above are believed to be held because of alleged attempts to revive the sect. AI believes that they are being held for the peaceful expression of their religious beliefs and calls on the Malaysian Government to either charge them with a recognisable criminal offence or release them.
