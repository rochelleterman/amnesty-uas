 Dadang Trisasongko, a human rights lawyer arrested on 19 October 1992, was released on 23 October pending further investigation of his case. The charge of ""subversion"" has been dropped but he still faces charges of ""expressing hostility toward the government"" and ""incitement"". If convicted, the maximum penalties for these offences are seven and six years respectively. The police maintain that there is a basis for the allegation that he opposed the government. "
