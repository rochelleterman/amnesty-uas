 UA 301/94 - Venezuela: death threats: Staff of the Network for Peace and Justice (Red de Apoyo por la Justicia y la Paz) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 5 August 1994 two staff members of the Red de Apoyo por la Justicia y la Paz received death threats in an anonymous phone call to their office. These threats are the latest in a series against the Caracas-based human rights organization. There is increasing concern for the safety of its staff. AI visited Venezuela in June 1994 and raised its concerns about these death threats with high-level authorities. The Red de Apoyo por la Justicia y la Paz has presented a formal complaint about these latest threats to the Attorney General's office in Caracas."
