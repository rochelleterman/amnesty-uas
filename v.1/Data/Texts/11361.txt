 India: Death Penalty/fear of imminent execution: Praveen Kumar 

 | Amnesty International 
 Praveen Kumar (m) aged 43, who was sentenced to death in 2002, may be facing imminent execution. The case is before the President and state governor who have the power to commute the sentence. However, the President dismissed another mercy petition earlier this month, and this led to the country's first execution in seven years.
