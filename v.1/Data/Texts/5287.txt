 The village of El Paramo is being terrorized by members of the army and army-backed paramilitaries. Reports indicate that the latter have extrajudicially executed one villager, Lorgio Antonio Garcia and soldiers have fired shots at and searched the houses of Ramon Diaz and Samuel Pineda. Other villagers have also been threatened. Paramilitaries acting in concern with the army set up a road block outside the village, and the army have set up a base inside the village. Ten families have left their homes and land in El Paramo as a result of the terror."
