 At least one UA participant has received a letter, dated 31 May 1995, from their local Myanmar Embassy in reference to the 11 May follow-up to this action (ASA 16/11/95). The letter claims that the above named were arrested because they tried to ""... snatch away the remains of U Nu against the wishes of U Nu's family, with the purpose of instigating civil unrest and strife... "". Independent reports suggest, however, that the young activists were peaceful in their activities and did not attempt to remove U Nu's body. AI considers them to be prisoners of conscience and continues to call for their immediate and unconditional release."
