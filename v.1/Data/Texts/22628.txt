 NA 
 According to press reports, on 23 March 2008 the appeal court quashed the death sentence against Faisal Fouzan al-Otaibi and upheld a sentence against him for the payment of blood money. 
He was sentenced to death for causing the deaths of three men, and injuring two others, in a car crash in 2005. If the death sentence is reinstated, Amnesty International will continue to appeal on behalf of Faisal Fouzan al-Otaibi.
