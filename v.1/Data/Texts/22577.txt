 Saudi Arabia: Men detained for founding political party | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Four Saudi Arabian men are believed to be held in virtual incommunicado detention in al-Haâ€™ir prison in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh. They are all at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Amnesty International is concerned that they may be held solely for the peaceful expression of their right to freedom of expression and association and therefore be prisoners of conscience."
