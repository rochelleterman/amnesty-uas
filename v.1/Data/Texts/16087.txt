 Three independent journalists were reportedly extrajudicially executed in Dushanbe between 20 and 22 December 1992. They were said to have been detained in the street and summarily executed by pro-government forces subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The dead men were apparently suspected of being members of the opposition. A number of other journalists have reportedly fled the city and their publications have closed down. "
