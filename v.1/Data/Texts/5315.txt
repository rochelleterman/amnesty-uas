 There are increased fears for the safety of members of opposition political parties in Colombia after the killing of Rodrigo Florez, a member of the Patriotic Union (UP) and the Colombian Communist Party (PCC). According to reports he was killed when gunmen opened fire on the PCC/UP headquarters in Medellin, department of Antioquia. The building had been under police guard until 30 October when the guard was withdrawn without explanation. Oscar Chavarriaga and another person who happened to be near the building, were seriously injured. No one has claimed responsibility for this latest killing."
