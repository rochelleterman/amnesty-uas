 Mexico: Fear for safety/Legal concern | Amnesty International 
 A 72-year-old indigenous woman, Ernestina Ascencio Rosario, was reportedly raped and tortured by soldiers of the army's 63rd Infantry Battalion on 25 February. She later died as a result of her injuries. If the military authorities handle the investigation of the attack, as    they usually do in this type of case, the community Ernestina Ascencio came from, and potential witnesses may face intimidation, and those responsible may not face an impartial and independent investigation and trial.
