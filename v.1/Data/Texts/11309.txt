 UA 366/93 - India: disappearance / fear of torture: Gurnam Kaur, Mokham Singh | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 1 June 1993 Gurnam Kaur was taken from her home at Cheema Park, New Model Town, Ludhiana by armed police. She was apparently seen in the custody of Tarn Taran police on 4 June and on 1 September. The Tarn police chief, Ajit Singh Sandhu, reportedly stated that she was in custody under his supervision. However, despite telegrams sent to the Punjab authorities by her family, her whereabouts remain unknown. On 4 October, her husband, Mokham Singh, the Secretary of the Babbar Akali Dal political party, was abducted by men in plainclothes, believed to be police from Punjab. He is also missing. There is grave concern for the couple's safety. "
