 NA 
 The judicial punishments of flogging and amputation, described as the ""purification"" laws have now been introduced. These laws, which came into effect in February, provide for the amputation of limbs for theft, and execution for murder, rape and some types of sexual offences. There are also fears that these laws may be used to punish political opponents."
