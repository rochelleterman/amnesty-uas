 Human rights defender Eudo Lustosa Brasil recently recently investigated and made public reports that military police had tortured inmates at a high security prison in the state of Acre. In the past few days he has survived an attempt on his life, and has received numberous death threats. Amnesty International believes that the attack and threat are directly linked to his work, and he and his colleagues are in grave danger.
