 Socialist Republic of Viet Nam: Health concern / prisoner of conscience: Dong Tuy | Amnesty International 
 The health of prisoner of conscience Dong Tuy has deteriorated to the point where he is unable to stand up straight or walk without assistance. He is reportedly not receiving proper medical treatment, and is also suffering from loss of memory and concentration. Dong Tuy has been in poor health since his arrest in November 1993. At different times his medical problems have included beri beri, stomach and lung problems, high blood pressure and trembling limbs, which may have apparently worsened under the conditions of his imprisonment.
