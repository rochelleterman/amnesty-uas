 Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: Stop destruction of Palestinian family home | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Israeli authorities are preparing to demolish a Palestinian family's home in East Jerusalem, on the grounds that it was built without a permit. Ahmad Ghoshe and his extended family have lived in the same house for generations. In June 2006 he built a small apartment on top of the house and three months later, the Jerusalem Municipality ordered its demolition. On 8 July 2009, after long court proceedings, the demolition order was scheduled to be carried out ""imminently."" "
