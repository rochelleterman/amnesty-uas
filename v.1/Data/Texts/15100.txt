 NA 
 Sakir Oner, a Kurdish villager, has ""disappeared"" after being detained on 24 July 1994 by members of the Angule gendarmerie, while attempting to travel to Diyarbakir. He had been threatened by the security forces not to leave his village of Angule near Lice in Diyarbakir province. Since the maximum period for political detainees to be held incommunicado in provinces under emergency legislation is 30 days, there is grave concern for his safety."
