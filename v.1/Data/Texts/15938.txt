 Ukraine: Fear of imminent execution: Andrey Yevtemy | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that Andrey Yevtemy, aged 21, may be facing imminent execution after his appeal against his death sentence was turned down by the Supreme Court on 16 May 1996. Amnesty International is appalled that executions are continuing in Ukraine, a year after it joined the Council of Europe and committed itself to imposing an immediate moratorium on executions.
