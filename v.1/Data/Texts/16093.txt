 Tajikistan: Fear of imminent execution/ death             penalty/fear for safety/ harsh prison conditions -        Dilfuza Numonova | Amnesty International 
 Dilfuza Numonova is believed to be in danger of imminent  execution. She was sentenced to death by Dushanbe City    Court in January, at a reportedly unfair trial, for the   November 1999 shooting of her lover, Kamil Kurbanov. On   14 March the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence. Her only hope of escaping execution is clemency from the      President, who has the power to commute death sentences   when all other appeals have been exhausted.
