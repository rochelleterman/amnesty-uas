 Donald Beardslee was executed in California in the first few minutes of 19 January. He had been sentenced to death in 1984 for the murder in 1981 of Paula Geddling. A recent examination had revealed that he suffered from severe brain damage, which the jurors who sentenced him to death did not know.
