 Syria: Fear of torture / medical concern / possible prisoner of conscience: Nouh Rasul Mustafa | Amnesty International 
 Nouh Rasul Mustafa, a disabled Syrian Kurd, was arrested at his home in Qamishli on 14 April 1997 and is being held at an unknown location. He is believed to have been arrested by members of Syrian military intelligence who were reportedly looking for his brother Nasreddin Mustafa. There is concern that Nouh Rasul Mustafa may be a prisoner of conscience, held as a hostage for his brother, and that he may be subjected to torture in incommunicado detention. There is further concern that he may require medical attention.
