 Pakistan: Further information on Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that Munawar Mohsin, previously referred to as Munwarul Hasan, has been the victim of an unfair trial and that he may face victimisation while in prison. On 8 July 2003, he was found guilty of the publication of a blasphemous letter in the Pakistani newspaper The Frontier Post. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of Pakistani Rs.50,000. His other co-accused have been acquitted on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to establish a case against them.
