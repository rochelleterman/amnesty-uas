 Bolivia: Further information on medical action: Wilfredo Vela Maldonado | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Wilfredo Vela Maldonado is a 20-year-old insulin-dependent diabetic imprisoned in September 1992 and awaiting trial on charges of planting explosives for the EGTK, an armed group which claims to act on behalf of indigenous peoples. Since his imprisonment he has experienced considerable difficulty in controlling his diabetes; he has required urgent hospitalization on five occasions and has entered coma more than once. He has a diabetic cataract and in August 1992 tested positive for typhoid infection. AI is concerned that the medical facilities and conditions at San Sebastian prison are inadequate to allow proper control of his diabetes. While recognizing the gravity of the charges against him, AI appeals for measures to provide him with proper medical care."
