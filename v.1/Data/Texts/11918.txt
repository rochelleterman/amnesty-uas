 Cambodia: Further information on fear for safety / prisoners of conscience: Kim San and Meas Minear | Amnesty International 
 Kim San and Meas Minear, human rights workers from        LICADHO, the Cambodian League for the Defence of Human    Rights, remain in detention following their arrest on 21  December 1998. They had been monitoring demonstrations in Sihanoukville against the dumping of toxic waste, and     have been charged with robbery and damage to property.    These charges are believed to be politically motivated    and without foundation. Amnesty International is calling  for their immediate release as prisoners of conscience.
