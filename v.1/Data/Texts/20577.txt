 NA 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the health and well-being of Guantánamo detainee Binyam Mohamed, particularly following the US government’s announcement that it has charged him for trial by military commission. His mental and physical health are reported to be precarious after years of indefinite detention, and alleged torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in Pakistan, Morocco, Afghanistan and Guantánamo."
