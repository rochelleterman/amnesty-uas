 Zaire/Rwanda: Refoulement / fear for safety: Around 50 Rwandese refugees in Zaire | Amnesty International 
 There is concern for the safety of some 50 Rwandese refugees in Kinshasa who are at risk of being sent to eastern Zaire or Rwanda. On 28 February 1997 about 43 of them were flown to Kisangani and were expected to be transferred to Tingi-Tingi refugee camp in eastern Zaire. About six others are awaiting repatriation to Rwanda. There is concern that those deported from Kinshasa are at risk of abuses from the AFDL or the Rwandese authorities.
