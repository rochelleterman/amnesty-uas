 Nepal: Fear for Safety/Fear of Torture | Amnesty International 
 Seven men were released from prison in Nepalgunj, Banke district, on 21 June, on the orders of an appeal court. The security forces are apparently planning to re-arrest them. According to local human rights groups people arrested in districts outside Kathmandu are more likely to be tortured and ill-treated or ""disappear"" and Amnesty International is very concerned for their safety.
