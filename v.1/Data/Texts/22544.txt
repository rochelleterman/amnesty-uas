 Some 200 Eritrean nationals previously held in Libya are no longer at imminent risk of forcible return to Eritrea, where they would have been at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. On 7 July, the Libyan authorities announced the release of 400 Eritrean nationals from detention centres where they had been held, and the decision to grant them three-month residency permits."
