 UA 275/94 - Turkey: ""disappearance"": M Sah Dogrucu | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 M Sah Dogrucu has ""disappeared"" after being detained in Diyarbakir on 7 July 1994. He and his family had been living there since their home in the village of Gokcetevek (Kurdish: Reseke) was burnt down during a raid by the security forces. On 7 July his house in the Baglar Quarter of Diyarbakir was raided by four people, one in commando uniform. After searching the house and striking his daughter-in-law when she protested, they then took M Sah Dogrucu away. There are fears for his life in the light of the recent murder of imam Suleyman Turgut whose body was found close to the village of Camili near Idil on 15 July after ""disappearing"" two days earlier. Both men had previously been detained and allegedly tortured."
