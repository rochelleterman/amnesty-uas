 Ethiopia: Fear of torture / Prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Large numbers of demonstrating students have been detained in two days of protests following the announcement of provisional results from the parliamentary elections of 15 May by the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE). Amnesty International fears that, as after university demonstrations in 2001, the students may be held incommunicado, beaten, forced to do harsh exercises, given very little food and denied medical treatment. They are also at risk of being kept in custody on criminal charges for long periods of time.
