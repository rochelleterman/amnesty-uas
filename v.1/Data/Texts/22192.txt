 Mahboubeh Karami, journalist and womenâ€™s rights defender, was removed from a bus and arrested by plain clothed security forces on 13 June. The bus had travelled past Mellat Park, Tehran, shortly after a demonstration had been held there. About 200 other people are known to have been arrested in connection with the demonstration. Amnesty International is not aware of any violence on the part of the protesters. The current whereabouts of all, including Mahboubeh Karami, are unknown and they are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment."
