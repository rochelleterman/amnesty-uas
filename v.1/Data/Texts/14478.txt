 NA 
 Serif Avsar was taken away by village guards and two other men on 22 April 1994. He has not been seen since. The authorities deny that he is being held. The village guards involved in the abduction are on a list of eight village guards from Sini village near Hazro in Diyarbakir province. None have apparantly been questioned about the abduction. AI has identified Harzo as being at the centre of a cluster of ""disappearances"" since 1991. Serif Avsar's family received an anonymous telephone call threatening more ""disappearances"" on 22 April. There are fears for the life of Serif Avsar."
