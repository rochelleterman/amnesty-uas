 Turkey: Further Information on Fear for safety/ ill-treatment/ legal concern: Mehmet Bal (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Conscientious objector Mehmet Bal was released from military custody on 24 June 2008, and has returned to his home in Istanbul. However, he is still on trial for his refusal to serve in the army. The next hearing is scheduled for 25 August, at which point he could be sent back to military custody. Amnesty International will consider Mehmet Bal to be a prisoner of conscience if he is deprived of his liberty for his conscientious objection to military service."
