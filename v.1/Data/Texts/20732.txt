 USA: Solidarity with Native American-run shelters 

 | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Today there are few options for Native American and Alaska Native  women fleeing violence. Native American and Alaska Native-run shelters are important as they can create culturally respectful spaces and advocacy for these women. Such shelters and programs are an essential component in addressing the high levels of violence against Native American and Alaska Native women.  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            "
