 Over 250 civilians (including Belama Nigga, Chale Nigga, Gaddise Dagafa, Imabet Taressa, Tadalu Nigga, Tafarra Galasaa, Zannu Nigga, Irena Iticha and Dejene Chimdi, plus other civilians from the Tukur Inchinni district of the Oromia region) have apparently been arbitrarily arrested by the Ethiopian government in recent days. Among those arrested are several high school students and at least two elderly people over the age of 70. They are at risk of torture or ill-treatment.
