"Cuba: Fear of unfair trial/possible Prisoners of Conscience 
 Cuba: Fear of unfair trial/possible Prisoners of Conscience | Amnesty International 
 Five men (Renâ Montes de Oca Martija, Roberto de Jes£s Guerra Pârez, Emilio Leyva Pârez, LÊzaro Alonso RomÊn and Manuel Pârez Soria) are due to go on trial on 19 and 20 December and Amnesty International is concerned that they may not receive a fair trial. The right to a fair trial is severely limited in Cuba, with the courts and prosecutors under government control. Amnesty International believes that they have been detained solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression, association and assembly, and if so would consider them prisoners of conscience.
