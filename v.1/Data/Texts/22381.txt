 Iraq: Call for Independent Investigations into War Crimes of Torture in Iraq | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Recent evidence of torture and ill-treatment by Coalition Forces in Iraqi prisons echo the frequent reports of      human rights violations received by Amnesty International during the past year. Urge the US and UK authorities to   support a thorough, independent and public investigation; to hold accountable all who have committed acts of        torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and also those who have contributed to a command culture that      condones such abuses; and to ensure that all Coalition    Forces know that such violations will not be tolerated."
