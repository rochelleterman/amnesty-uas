 Cameroon: Further information on torture and ill-treatment / possible prisoners of conscience / medical concern / death in custody: reports of torture amid large-scale arrests | Amnesty International 
 Another of those detained following violent incidents in North-West Province in late March 1997 is reported to have died of torture. Richard Ngwa Formasoh reportedly died in the Central Prison, Yaounde, on 6 July as a result of injuries sustained during torture and ill-treatment at the time of his arrest and during his detention at the Gendarmerie Legion in Bamenda. His death heightens concerns for those still detained, in particular Ndifet Zacharia Khan, a traditional medicine practitioner, who was reportedly badly beaten and is said to have developed extensive gangrene with a bullet wound to his thigh.
