 Tunisia: Further information on health concern for hunger strike prisoners | Amnesty International 
 Concern is mounting for the Tunisian prisoners on hunger  strike, some of whom have not eaten for up to 64 days and are suffering severe health problems. Fathi    Karraoud,  Yacine Ben Zarti,Ahmed    Amari,   Zuhair     Yacoub,     and  at least ten others   have been on hunger  strike    repeatedly in recent months. Prison conditions    are     extremely poor and prisoners do not have access to        medical care, thier families or legal representatives.    Abdelatif Bouhajila  is apparently confined to a wheel    chair. He has reportedly been ill-treated while on hunger strike. Noureddine Amdouni and  Abdallah       Drissa,    have been   transferred to other prisons.
