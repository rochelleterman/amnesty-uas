 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of Abdallah Bashir who may have ""disappeared"". He has not been seen since his arrest by the National Security Forces on 31 July in Kalma camp, near Nyala in South Darfur state. He may be detained incommunicado in the military hospital in Nyala, after allegedly being tortured. Alternatively, he may have been transferred to the capital Khartoum.
