 UA 314/94 - Turkey: fear of ""disappearance"" / fear of torture: Bisar Kurt | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Bisar Kurt was detained in Midyat on 6 August 1994 and has since ""disappeared"" in unacknowledged detention. He moved to Midyat after the destruction of his village by the security forces four years ago. His 15-year-old son went missing shortly after the move and Bisar Kurt was told by the authorities that he had gone to join the PKK. Bisar Kurt has had to report to the local gendarmerie post once a week since then. Bisar Kurt's family has heard nothing of him since his detention. There are grave fears for his life."
