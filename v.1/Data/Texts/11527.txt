 Indonesian security forces have reportedly arrested close relatives of Xanana Gusmao, the captured East Timorese resistance leader. His sister, Armadino Gusmao, was reportedly arrested early on 24 November 1992, along with her husband and two of their children. Their place of detention is not known and there are fears that they may be interrogated under torture. Other members of the family are feared to be at risk of arbitrary detention. The authorities have yet to clarify the whereabouts of Xanana Gusmao and to announce the charges against him and seven members of the Araujo family also arrested on 20 November. "
