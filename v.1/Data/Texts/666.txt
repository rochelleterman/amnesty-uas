 Equatorial Guinea: Further Information on Torture/Health concern/Fear for Safety | Amnesty International 
 The government of Equatorial Guinea has released a list of the 14 people detained incommunicado in Black Beach prison in the capital, Malabo. They are the surviving members of a group of 15 alleged mercenaries arrested on 9 March in Malabo and accused of plotting a coup against President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. One of them died on 17 March, apparently as a result of torture.
