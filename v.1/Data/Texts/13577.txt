 EXTRA 30/93 - Taiwan (Republic of China): death penalty: Liu Huan-jong | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Justice Ministry has denied a request by the lawyer of Liu Huan-jong, sentenced to death for murder in 1992, to present a new special appeal. AI fears that he may be executed later this month. AI is also concerned that, like all prisoners under death sentence, Liu Huan-jong has been wearing feet shackles permanently for several years. This constitutes a major breach of international standards for the protection of the rights of prisoners. "
