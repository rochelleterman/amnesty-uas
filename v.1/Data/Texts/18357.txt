 Saudi Arabia: Fear for Safety: Fatima A (f)

 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is gravely concerned that the safety and security of Fatima, a 34 year old woman and mother of two children, will be jeopardised if a court divorce judgement against her is enforced. She has forcibly been divorced from her husband following a court case initiated by her half-brother using his powers as her male guardian. If sent back to her brother's home, Fatima may become a victim of domestic violence.
