 Tanzania: Further information on Fear of Torture/Prisoners of Conscience | Amnesty International 
 Prisoners of conscience Juma Duni Haji and Machano Khamis Ali were released on 15 October, after a Zanzibar court dropped the charges of murder against them. Suleiman Seif, Ahmed Seif and others who had been charged with the murder of a police officer are now known to have been among those released in June. Hundreds of others have been charged in connection with the demonstrations, but these charges will apparently be reviewed in the next few days.
