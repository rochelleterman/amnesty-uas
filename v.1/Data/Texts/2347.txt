 There are serious concerns for the safety of the two men named above who survived a shooting on 28 November 1994. Qweleba's two brothers, Vusi and Mthembeni, were killed in the attack. Three months earlier, members of his family were assaulted by members of the Internal Stability Unit of the police, who threatened to kill Mthembeni, if they found him."
