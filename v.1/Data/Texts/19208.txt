 Tunisia: Prisoner of conscience / fear of further POCs | Amnesty International 
 Mohamed Mouadda, former leader of opposition party, Mouvement des Democrates Socialistes (MDS), and other conditionally released prisoners of conscience: There is concern that Mohamed Mouadda, former leader of the MDS was placed under house arrest on 14 April 1997. His arrest follows months of official harassment since his conditional release from prison in late 1996. Amnesty International again considers him to be a prisoner of conscience and is calling for his immediate and unconditional release. There is also concern for other conditionally released prisoners of conscience, including Najib Hosni and Mohamed Hedi Sassi.
