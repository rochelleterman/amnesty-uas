 Nepal: Fear for safety: Jitman Basnet (m) 

 | Amnesty International 
 Human rights lawyer Jitman Basnet has received death threats, which he believes are connected to a book he has recently published about the time he spent in army custody. At least one of the threats came from a man who claimed to be one of the people he had named in his book as responsible for raping, torturing or unlawfully killing people during the conflict in Nepal. Amnesty International believes his life may be in danger.
