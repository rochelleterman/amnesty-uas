 Five Indigenous communities in Itakyry district, eastern Paraguay, are no longer facing imminent forced eviction from their ancestral lands. However, the Brazilian farmers who claim they own the land used an aeroplane to spray a toxic substance over the communities, resulting in more than 200 people needing medical treatment. The communities are at risk of further reprisals.   "
