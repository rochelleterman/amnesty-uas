 Saudi Arabia: Fear of Imminent Execution: Al-Qahtani  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A death row prisoner known as Al-Qahtani was given a one month stay of execution only moments before his sentence was due to be carried out on 1 January, 2008.  A number of tribal leaders and the head of a pardons committee are reportedly urging the family of the victim to pardon Al-Qahtani. However, until this happens he remains at risk of imminent execution. "
