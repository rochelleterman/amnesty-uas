 AI is concerned about reports that Gisele Saint-Firmin is being beaten in custody and is being refused access to her lawyer. She is the mother of the local branch secretary of Lavalas, the political movement which supported deposed President Aristide. The military in Les Cayes have apparently stated that they would only free Gisele Saint-Firmin if her daughter gave herself up. Gisele Saint-Firmin is 53 and suffers from high blood pressure and cirrhosis. There is no further information on the others named above. "
