 On 2 November 1993 a sentence of 40 lashes by flogging was carried out on eight of the men named above. The imposition of the sentence on Hisham al- Kareb and Abdin Miheisi is reported to have been postponed for two weeks after they submitted medical reports indicating that they were not physically fit enough to withstand the punishment. However, Kamal Mekki Medani was flogged despite medical evidence that he suffered from hypertension and diabetes. The ten men were convicted of consuming alcohol after an unfair trial on 11 September 1993 at a Public Order Court hearing. "
