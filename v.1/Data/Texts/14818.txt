 On 24 April 1996 at 2am in the Sutculer district of Antalya, plainclothes police searched the home of Hayrettin Kanat, a Kurdish construction worker, before forcibly taking him away in handcuffs. His family have since made inquiries with the Sanay and the Cumhuriyet police as well as with Antalya Police Headquarters, but all have denied any knowledge of his detention and there is now grave concern for his safety.
