 Mexico: Migrants at risk of harm | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 3 October, at least 40 irregular migrants (those without travel documents) crossing Mexico were kidnapped from a freight train, allegedly by a criminal gang. Their fate is unknown and there are fears for their safety. In a neighbouring state, other irregular migrants are at risk of ill-treatment and injury as a result of migrant control operations."
