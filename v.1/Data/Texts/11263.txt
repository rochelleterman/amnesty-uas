 India: Death penalty/Fear of execution, Ram Deo Chauhan   (alias Raj Nath Chauhan). | Amnesty International 
 Ram Deo Chauhan is facing execution, after the Supreme Court on 10 May dismissed a petition seeking review of its July 2000 judgement upholding his death sentence. There is strong evidence that he was 15 at the time of the murder of which he was convicted. His only hope of escaping the gallows is a mercy petition that has been lodged with the Governor of Assam and a recent call by the National Human Rights Commission that his sentence be commuted.
