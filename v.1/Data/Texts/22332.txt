 Blogger Hossein Derakhshan was arrested at his family home in Tehran on 1 November 2008. Denied access to his family and to legal representation, no one knows where Hossein Derakhshan is held. Although he has been allowed to make four telephone calls to his home, each lasting around one minute, the last was in late November. He may face torture or other ill-treatment while held incommunicado."
