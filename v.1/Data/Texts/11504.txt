 Indonesia / East Timor: fear of torture / arbitrary detention: up to 30 pro-independence supporters detained in Dili and Liquiza | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 4 March 1995, up to 30 East Timorese, including several civil servants, were arrested by the Indonesian army in Dili and in Liquiza. AI fears for their safety, in view of recent reports of torture of detainees in military custody. AI is also concerned that some of them may be prisoners of conscience. East Timor's military chief, Colonel Kiki Syahnakri, was quoted as saying that they were arrested because they were believed to be supporters of the Fretilin. However, last week, Indonesia's own National Commission on Human Rights said that there had been no indications of resistance in Liquiza for the last 10 years."
