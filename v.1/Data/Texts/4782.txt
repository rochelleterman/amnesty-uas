 Colombia: Fear for Safety/Possible ""Disappearance"" | Amnesty International 
 A trade union leader, Jaime Alberto Duque Castro, has been abducted by army-backed paramilitaries. Amnesty International is concerned for his safety, and for that of other trade union members in the area, especially given that at least 25 trade unionists have been killed this year, most of them by paramilitaries.
