 NA 
 On 27 February 2009, the whereabouts of Gheorghe Ionel, became unknown. Gheorghe Ionel is mayor of Vorniceni and a member of an opposition coalition. It is believed that he may have been abducted by law enforcement officers as he was last seen being forced by police officers into a car outside the court in Stra≈üeni, where he had just been cleared of the charge of misusing his official position. Amnesty International fears that he may have been subjected to enforced disappearance and is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment."
