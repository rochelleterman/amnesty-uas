 EXTRA 32/93 - Bosnia-Herzegovina: fear of death penalty: Borislav Herak, Sretko Damjanovic | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Borislav Herak and Sretko Damjanovic, two Serbs, went on trial on 12 March 1993 before a military court in Sarajevo on charges of genocide, rape and looting. The military prosecutor has called for the death penalty. Borislav Herak has admitted his guilt and reportedly stated that he wishes to be punished by the death penalty. Sretko Damjanovic denies his guilt and alleges that he was beaten during investigation and forced to make incriminating statements. The trial continues. While acknowledging the seriousness of the crimes with which the two men are charged, AI is appealing to the Bosnian authorities not to sentence the men to death. "
