 UA 29/94 - Colombia: extrajudicial execution / fear for safety: Gilberto Claro Lozano | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern at the apparent extrajudicial execution of Gilberto Claro Lozano on 19 January 1994 in the city of Ocana, department of Norte de Santander. He was reportedly shot four times in the head by two unidentified individuals as they rode past him on a motorbike at midday in the market square. At the time of his killing the city was under military occupation, but his killers were allowed to escape unchallenged. Gilberto Claro Lozano was the former mayor of the the municipality of Playa de Belen. During his time in office he was reportedly persistently harassed by the security forces because of his work for the community. Just one hour before his death, he had announced his candidature for reelection in the forthcoming municipal elections."
