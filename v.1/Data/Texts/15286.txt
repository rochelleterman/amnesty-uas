 Mahmut Ozkan, Evren Ozkan, Abdullah Ozkan, Sehmuz Ozkan, Cuco Ozkan and his sister Nezan were released on 5 December 1992; Halil Ozkan had apparently not been detained. All the others and Hayriye Ozkan, 18-year-old daughter of Mahmut, were charged and committed to prison in Urfa; charges are thought to concern support for the PKK. Mahmut Ozkan, aged 60, was reportedly forced to watch the torture of members of his family, including his 15-year-old son, Lokman, who suffers from jaundice. None was issued with a medical certificate when examined at the end of the detention period. "
