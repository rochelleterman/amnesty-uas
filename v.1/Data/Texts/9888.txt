 About four hours before Elijah Page, white, aged 24, was due to be put to death in South Dakota on 29 August, Governor Mike Rounds ordered a stay of execution on the grounds that there was a discrepancy between the state's law on lethal injection and the method that was about to be used to kill Elijah Page. The stay will last until after 1 July 2007.
