 Demonstrations in Iran continued following the Iranian presidential election on 12 June 2009. Iranâ€™s state media reported that at least 475 people were arrested during post-election clashes and that up to 13 people died, and many more were injured. Amnesty International believes that those arrested are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment, and that other demonstrators are at risk of unlawful killing or even extrajudicial execution.  "
