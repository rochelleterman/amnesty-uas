 Political activist and probable prisoner of conscience Pulat Akhunov is at serious risk of ill-treatment in detention. Currently serving a total of four and a half years' imprisonment on allegedly fabricated criminal charges, he has recently been transferred to a prison camp for especially dangerous criminals. It is feared that this transfer was organized by the authorities deliberately to place Pulat Akhunov at risk of violence from his fellow inmates. "
