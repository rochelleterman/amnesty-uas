 AI fears for the safety of many people who have been arrested in the recent unrest in Bahrain. AI also fears for the safety of demonstrators, following reports of more killings by security forces using live ammunition against unarmed civilians. Shaikh 'Abd al-Amir Mansur al-Jamri, a prominent Shi'a Muslim religious scholar and his family were placed under house arrest on 1 April 1995 and have since been denied access to the outside world. Protests against these measures resulted in the security forces shooting at unarmed civilians. Others reportedly detained include a 12 year old girl. Two men (named above) were killed and others seriously injured. One student is reported to have been killed when live ammunition was used to quell disturbances at the University of Bahrain."
