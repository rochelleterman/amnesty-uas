 The four men named above have reportedly been subjected to torture and ill-treatment since their arrests and detention in May 2003. They are being held in conditions which are said to be extremely unhealthy, dehumanising and degrading. They have spent prolonged periods incommunicado and three of the men have only been allowed only one visit during 15 months' detention, whilst one has received no visits at all. The men are reported to be infested with lice and are allowed to take a cold shower only once or twice a month.
