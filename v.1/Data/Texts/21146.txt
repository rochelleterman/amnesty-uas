 Nepal: Torture/Arbitrary detention: Umesh Lama | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Umesh Lama was arrested on 1 April 2008, for reasons unclear, and was tortured by police, according to a local human rights organisation. He is now under police guard in Bir Hospital in Kathmandu where he is receiving treatment for injuries caused by the torture. He may be returned to a police station where he would be at risk of further torture and other ill-treatment; he should have been brought before a court within 24 hours of arrest, but he was not."
