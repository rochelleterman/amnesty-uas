 There remains concern about the health of the three men named above. Ali Moosa Didi, who suffers from a heart condition, was transferred from Dhoonidhoo detention centre to Male' police headquarters. His health has reportedly deteriorated rapidly and he has been seen in hospital by his relatives, although they were not allowed to speak to him. Mohamed Shafeeq is now under house arrest and is allowed to receive visitors. However, reports indicate that he is physically weak, which may be as a result of ill-treatment he received while at Dhoonidhoo detention centre. To date none of the three have been charged or brought before a court."
