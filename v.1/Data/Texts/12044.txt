 AI is concerned about the detention of Hwang Suk-yong, a writer aged 50, who was arrested on 27 April 1993 at Seoul Airport as he returned to South Korea from self-imposed exile in the USA. He is charged with having visited North Korea in 1989. His current place of detention is not known but he is believed to be held at the headquarters of the ANSP in Seoul. AI fears that he is at risk of ill-treatment during interrogation. "
