 Rwanda: Medical action: ""Marked for death"" - rape survivors living with HIV/AIDS in Rwanda | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 This action circular forms a component of the wider       action being organized around publication of the report   ""Marked for death"" - rape survivors living with HIV/AIDs  in Rwanda and focuses on chapter 8 of the report, ""Access to        healthcare.""  The report, released on 7th April 2004, describes the situation faced by      women         survivors of the violence - many of whom continue   to    die from diseases related to HIV/AIDs, which they         contracted through rape - and their families.
