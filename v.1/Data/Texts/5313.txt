 Colombia: Further information on Fear for Safety, Activists with the Organizaci√≥n Femenina Popular | Amnesty International 
 Army-backed paramilitaries have reportedly threatened to kill OFP members, after they helped organise three days of events and marches in Barrancabermeja, calling on both sides in Colombia's civil conflict to respect the human rights of civilians. They have declared 11 families who took part in the 14-17 August event to be ""military targets"". These families and human rights workers in the region are in grave danger.
