 At least seven child offenders are currently under sentence of death in the Philippines.    Ramon Nicodemus, Saturani Panggayong, Roger Pagsibigan, Elmer Butal,       Christopher Padua, Ronald Bragas and Larina Perpinan were reportedly under the age of 18 at the time their alleged  crimes were committed.  They were sentenced to death in   flagrant contravention of both Philippine domestic law    and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), to   which the Philippines is party."
