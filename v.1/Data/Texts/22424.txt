 Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: Fear for safety: 1.5 Million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned that the further tightening by the Israeli government of its blockade on the Gaza Strip is causing a worsening of the humanitarian crisis there. Israelâ€™s decision to cut off the reduced supplies of fuel and electricity and to shut down the restricted passage of humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip is making dire humanitarian situation desperate for the 1.5 million Palestinians who live there."
