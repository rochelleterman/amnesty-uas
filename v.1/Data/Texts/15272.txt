 AI has learned that the body of 25-year-old shepherd Mehmet Akkum was found on 17 November 1992, dumped in a cemetery in Elazig about 140 km from Kursunlu village. He had been detained on 10 November 1992 along with another shepherd, 70-year-old Mehmet Akan, whose body was found in the fields shortly afterwards. Mehmet Akkum's body showed signs of severe torture and was mutilated. The other villagers named above remain ""disappeared"".
