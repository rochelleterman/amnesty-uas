 Syria: Mass arrests/Fear of torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Hundreds of Syrian Kurds have reportedly been arrested, and around 25 have been killed, following violent clashes at a football match on 12 March. Those detained appear to have been targeted because of their Kurdish ethnicity: their whereabouts are now unknown, and this puts them at grave risk of torture and ill-treatment.
