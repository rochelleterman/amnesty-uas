"Bosnia-Herzegovina: Further information on fear for safety 
 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Further information on fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned about the lack of safety and security for Bosnian Serbs who are returning to the Drvar municipality in western Bosnia-Herzegovina where levels of harassment are on the increase. An elderly couple, Vojin and Lela Trninic, were murdered on their return to their pre-war home village. There have since been further attacks made against members of minority groups returning to their homes. There have been demonstrations by both Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats and these have ended in violence.
