 Romania: Consensual homosexual relations continue to be punished under amended legislation | Amnesty International 
 On 10 September 1996, the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament adopted an amendment to Article 200 of the Penal Code punishing homosexual relations. In October 1993, Romania was accepted as a member of the Council of Europe on condition that the Penal Code should be amended so that homosexual acts in private between consenting adults were no longer penalized.
