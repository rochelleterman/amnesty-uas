 An estimated 20 people remain in detention following demonstrations in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, on 30 January and 2 February. They are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. From 14 February at least eleven people were released by the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), which shows that pressure on the authorities to release those detained might be having an impact."
