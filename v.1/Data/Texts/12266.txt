 Malaysia: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/fear of incommunicado detention | Amnesty International 
 Two men were arrested on 19 December by the Malaysian     police under the Internal Security Act (ISA), which       allows for indefinite detention without charge or trial.  It is not known where they are being held, or whether     they have access to legal representation or their         families.  Amnesty International is concerned that the    two men are at risk of torture or ill-treatment during    police interrogation.
