 Turkish security forces stormed 20 prisons on 19 December at about 4.30am, to end hunger strikes by political       prisoners. At least 20 prisoners, according to some       sources over 30 prisoners, and two gendarmes have         reportedly died in the course of the operation, which is  still under way in two of the prisons, Ümraniye and       Çanakkale."
