 Lourenco Adao Agostinho was tried on 24 May 1994 and found guilty on a charge of embezzlement. He was sentenced on 31 May to two years and six months' imprisonment, which was then reduced to 10 months'. There is concern that his defence lawyer was not given adequate time to prepare a defence case, and that he may have been subjected to deliberate harassment because of his activities connected with the Angolan Human Rights Association (ADHA). The case against William Tonet has apparently not yet come to court."
