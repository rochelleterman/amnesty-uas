 UA 306/93 - Indonesia / East Timor: arbitrary detention / fear of torture: fifty-three students | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Fifty three students and possibly many others, were arrested by Indonesian security forces in East Timor in advance of a visit by members of the United States Congress on 1 and 2 September 1993. Their current whereabouts are unknown. Reportedly the arrests were carried out to prevent pro- independence demonstrations. Indonesian military officials have denied the arrests, stating that they had been sent on a ""guidance course"" in Dili. Individuals sent on such courses are sometimes obliged to stay in military quarters and attend training courses in Pancasila, the state ideology. In other instances detainees are held at remote military posts where they are obliged to act as labourers and servants of the military. "
