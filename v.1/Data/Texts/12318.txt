 Malaysia: Threat of arrest: Participants in planned forum on alleged police abuses | Amnesty International 
 The Malaysian government has threatened to use the Internal Security Act (ISA) to detain without charge members of 10 local non-governmental organizations who plan to hold a forum on 12 January 1997 to discuss cases of alleged abuses of police power. Amnesty International would consider anyone arrested in this context to be a prisoner of conscience.
