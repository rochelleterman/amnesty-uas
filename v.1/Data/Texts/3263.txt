 At least 15 civilians, including a Red Cross worker, an 11-year-old child and a pregnant woman, were reportedly killed by troops in Kinshasa on 22 February 1993. The killings are said to have taken place during incidents following the killing of a civilian on 20 February 1993. The troops responsible are believed to be members of President Mobutu's Division Speciale Presidentielle. AI is concerned that DSP troops are carrying out extrajudicial executions with impunity following the recent riots. "
