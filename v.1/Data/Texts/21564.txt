 The Belarusian authorities must not execute Dzmitry Kanavalau and Uladzslau Kavalyou, who were sentenced to death on 30 November 2011, following a trial that has failed to meet international fair trial standards. Dzmitry Kanavalau has been found guilty of committing terrorist attacks and producing explosives, in connection with a series of bomb attacks in Belarus. Uladzslau Kavalyou was found guilty of assisting him and failing to inform the authorities. "
