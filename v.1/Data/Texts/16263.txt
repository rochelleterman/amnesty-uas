 Uzbekistan: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/ Prisoner of conscience, Saidzhakhon Zainabitdinov | Amnesty International 
 Human rights defender Saidzhakhon Zainabitdinov was reportedly arbitrarily detained by law enforcement officers on 21 May. He is believed to be held in police custody in the city of Andizhan, eastern Uzbekistan, and is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. His arrest is apparently linked to his role in monitoring recent events in Andizhan, in which hundreds of people were killed. Amnesty International believes him to be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for carrying out his peaceful and legitimate human rights work.
