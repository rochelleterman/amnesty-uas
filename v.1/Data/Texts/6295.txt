 Guatemala: Further information on fear for safety: Otto Leonel Hernandez | Amnesty International 
 AI remains seriously concerned for the safety of the above. On 3 July 1996 he was transferred from the Western Regional Hospital in Quezaltenengo City, where he was recovering from injuries sustained when he was abducted and tortured between 21 and 26 June, and taken to Totonicapan Prison. Although the investigating judge ordered that he should be held separately from other inmates, for safety reasons, AI has learned that he is being confined along with other inmates. It is feared that an attempt may be made on his life inside the prison.
