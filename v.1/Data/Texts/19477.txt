 Human rights activists Daniel Bekele and Netsanet Demissie were released on 28 March 2008, after being detained in Ethiopia since November 2005. The two men were released following a presidential pardon after they signed a letter “acknowledging mistakes” committed in relation to the 2005 elections. It is not yet clear if the pardon is unconditional."
