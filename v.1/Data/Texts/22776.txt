 Syria: Disappearance of Syrian Kurd student activist: Jaqar Khoen Mullah Ahmed | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Student activist, Jaqar Khoen Mullah Ahmed, a member of Syriaâ€™s Kurdish minority, has not been seen since 3 March. There are fears he may have been arrested by the security forces. If so, with the security forces denying he is in their custody, he has been subjected to enforced disappearance. He is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment."
