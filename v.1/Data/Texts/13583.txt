 Taiwan's Prosecutor General after three unsuccessful appeals is now reported to have decided not to lodge any further appeals against the death sentences of the above named men. Following this decision the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, lawyers from the Taiwan and Taipei Bar Associations and several legislators are planning to make their own appeal. There is grave concern that the trials of the three men were unfair and that they were convicted largely on the basis of their own confessions which they claim were extracted after ill-treatment by police."
