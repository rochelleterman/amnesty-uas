 Tajikistan: Impunity; Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Despite substantial evidence that Vladimir Vasilchikov, Elena Dudenkova and her husband Viktor Dudenkov were ill-treated by police, Tajik authorities have recently closed an investigation into allegations of their ill-treatment, stating they had found ""no sign of a crime"". Amnesty International fears for their safety and is concerned that the failure to thoroughly investigate the allegations encourages the pattern of impunity for ill-treatment by police.
