 Mexico: Fear for Safety | Amnesty International 
 Members of an indigenous Zapotec group in southern Mexico have been shot at and threatened, reportedly by           supporters of the ruling political party. Because the     authorities have taken no action, tensions are high in    the community, threatening further violence. Amnesty      International is concerned for the group's safety.
