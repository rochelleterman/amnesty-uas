 Colombia: Civilian population threatened in Colombia | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Paramilitaries have threatened the civilian population, and killed a peasant farmer, in a south-western municipality of Colombia. They have blockaded one hamlet since 28 November: 60 people have managed to flee, but those who remain are in danger, as are other peasant farmers in the municipality."
