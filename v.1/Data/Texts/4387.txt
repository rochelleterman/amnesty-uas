 Colombia: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 On 28 February 1996 a written death threat, addressed to Margarita Arregoces, was received by her lawyer, Reinaldo Villalba. It was signed by a paramilitary group called Colombia sin Guerrilla (COLSINGUE). Margarita Arregoces and her sister Lina Maria Arregoces, both teachers and popular activists, have recently been released from detention after being accused of being members of an armed opposition group. There is now grave concern for their safety.
