 Pilar Noriega (f), and Digna Ochoa (f), Enrique Flota, human rights lawyers; new name: Gracia Moheno (f), lawyer: On 7 Ocober 1996, Pilar Noriega and Gracia Moheno received death threats in the PRODH office in Mexico City while the two lawyers were on a plane to Washington to attend a meeting with the Interamerican Human Rights Commission for a presentation of the case of three extrajudicial executions by the Mexican army in Chiapas in 1994. AI remains deeply concerned for the safey of these and other members of PRODH, who are apparently being targeted because of their human rights work.
