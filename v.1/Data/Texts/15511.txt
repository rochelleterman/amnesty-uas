 Russia: Further information on Health concern/Denial of medical treatment: Mikhail Ivanovich Trepashkin (m), lawyer | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International continues to believe that lawyer Mikhail Trepashkin is receiving inadequate medical treatment at IK 13, an open prison colony located in the Sverdlovsk Region. The organization has received a copy of a doctor's report, stating that Mikhail Trepashkin's health is very poor, which under Russian legislation should allow him to be released on medical grounds. However, it is feared that he will instead be transferred to a stricter prison colony, where access to his lawyers and to other visitors would be restricted.
