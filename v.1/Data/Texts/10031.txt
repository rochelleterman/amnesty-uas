 USA (Missouri): Further information on death penalty: Marlin Gray (m), black | Amnesty International 
 Marlin Gray was executed as scheduled in Missouri on 26 October. He had been sentenced to death in December 1992 for his role in the 1991 rape and murder of sisters Julie and Robin Kerry. The state conceded at trial that he had not been present at the time the murders took place, but maintained that Gray had been the ringleader: three other men were also tried and convicted for their involvement in the crime.
