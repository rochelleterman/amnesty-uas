Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the      safety of a group of at least 10 people, including those  named above, who ""disappeared"" after they were abducted   by paramilitaries in the town of Suai, about 100          kilometres south of the capital, Dili. The organisation   is concerned for the safety of all supporters of East     Timorese independence in the area.
