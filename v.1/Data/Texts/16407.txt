 Yugoslavia (Kosovo): Further information on fear of torture / ill-treatment: ethnic Albanian former police employees | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Nine ethnic Albanian former police employees were convicted by the Pec district court on 19 April 1995 on charges of seeking to undermine Yugoslavia's integrity by force. Sherif Shala, Shaban Shala, Gani Hajdari, Dergut Bibaj and Xhevat Ibraj were sentenced to five years' imprisonment; Vllaznim Shehu to four years' imprisonment; Idriz Elezaj and Skender Krasniqi to two years' and Sefer Hasanaj to one years' imprisonment. Those with sentences of under five years were released pending appeal. There is concern that their trial was unfair, and that there have been repeated allegations that the defendants were tortured to obtain confessions following their arrest. On 3 May 1995 a further 44 former police employees are due to go on trial in Prizren, including Ramadan Ndrecaj, Rexhep Oruci, Salih Sokoli, Halil Kafexholli and Shaban Dana."
