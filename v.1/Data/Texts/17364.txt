 Iran: Further information on Fear of ""disappearance""/fear for safety/health concern/possible prisoner of conscience: Saleh Kamrani (m), lawyer and human rights defender | Amnesty International 
 Azeri Turkish lawyer Saleh Kamrani, aged about 34, is reportedly held without charge in Evin Prison in Tehran. In an interview on 19 June 2006 on Araz Radio, broadcasting from Sweden, Saleh Kamrani's wife, Mina Esgeri, said that she had been allowed to meet with her husband in detention on 18 June. He reportedly needs medication for a heart condition. He may be held solely for his work as a lawyer and human rights defender, in which case Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience.
