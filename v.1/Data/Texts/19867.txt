 Colombia: Close the laboratory of war | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The department of Arauca is on the front line of          Colombia's human rights crisis. It is rich in natural     resources and lies next to the Venezuelan border. The     region is therefore economically and militarily strategic to all the parties in Colombia's armed conflict - the     security forces, operating in alliance with paramilitary  groups, and guerrilla forces. These groups are fighting   an intense and escalating conflict for control of the     region.  It is a battle in which the people of the        department have come under attack from all sides."
