 Brazil: Fear for Safety / Death Threats / Unlawful Killings | Amnesty International 
 In recent weeks, Maria Joelma da Costa, President of the Rural Worker's Union (STR), in Rondon do Par‡, Par‡ State, has received numerous anonymous telephone calls at her home and office. She has been threatened that she will be killed unless she stops her work defending rural workers. Her limited police protection was reportedly withdrawn on 2 October, which has left her completely exposed. Amnesty International is seriously concerned for her safety and that of her colleagues.
