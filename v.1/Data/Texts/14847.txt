 A number of villages surrounding Evrek, near Beytussebab in Hakkari province, have been forcibly evacuated and many houses and crops burned by security forces because of villagers' refusal to join the system of village guards. Villagers are being detained in their villages and there have been reports that some have been beaten. The above named people have been detained in Evrek by police since early July 1994, and there are fears that they may be subjected to torture or ill-treatment."
