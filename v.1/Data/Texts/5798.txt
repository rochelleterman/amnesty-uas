 AI has learned that the gay men's group Entre Amigos received three death threats by telephone on 6 July 1995 from the anti-homosexual death squad La Sombra Negra, saying that they were going to come to their next meeting and kill everybody. Wilfredo Valencia Palacios, president of Entre Amigos and Deputy Director of the Oscar Romero AIDS Project, was threatened with death several times in late 1994 (see AMR 29/13/94)."
