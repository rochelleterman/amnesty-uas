 EXTRA 69/93 - USA (Texas): death penalty: Ruben Cantu | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ruben Cantu is scheduled to be executed on 24 August 1993. He is a juvenile offender of Latin-American descent. He was represented at trial by an inexperienced attorney, who failed to present evidence of his apparent troubled family background, or his psychological history. He was later examined by a psychiatrist who found him to be of sub-average intelligence. He was sentenced to death under a law which severely restricted the consideration of any mitigating circumstances at the sentencing hearing, and although the law was changed in September 1991, it has not been applied retroactively to cases such as Ruben Cantu's.
