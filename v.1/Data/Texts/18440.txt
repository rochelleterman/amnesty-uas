 Saudi Arabia: Further information on fear of flogging: Nine Saudi Arabian        Nationals 	

 | Amnesty International 
 Six men have been executed over the past few days, on     charges some of which related to their sexual             orientation. Because of the Saudi authorities' silence in the face of thousands of appeals, Amnesty International   fears that these six may have been among the nine men     reportedly sentenced to flogging and prison terms for     ""deviant sexual behaviour"". The remaining three may be at imminent risk of execution.
