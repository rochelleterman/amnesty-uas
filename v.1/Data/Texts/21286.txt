 Belgium: Shelter in dire need of funds | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The government must make sure that Belgium's first ever shelter for women does not have to go on turning down desperate appeals for help. Women abused at the hands of partners and other family members have been able to turn to the Centre for the Prevention of Domestic and Family Violence in Brussels for three decades. But the Centre's valuable service is at risk."
