 Jean-Emile Estimable, a journalist with Radio Cacique, was granted provisional liberty on 2 February 1993. He had been arrested and accused of carrying pro-Aristide leaflets. He was reportedly severely ill-treated while detained in St Marc Prison and forced to pay 100 gourdes in order to stop the beatings. He is suffering from chest and stomach pains as a result. "
