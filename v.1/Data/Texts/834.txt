 Ethiopia: Further information on fear of imprisonment as POC / fear of ill-treatment: Svetlana Mamedova (f) | Amnesty International 
 The Ethiopian Department for Immigration and Nationality Affairs has issued a press statement concerning the case of Svetlana Mamedova which includes some details concerning her citizenship and residency status over recent years and some information on her alleged ""crime"".
