 Oaxacan political activist David Venegas was freed on 5 March, after 11 months in prison. He had won several federal injunctions against his detention, but the authorities had delayed his release. He was released on bail but is still facing charges of ""possession of narcotics"" (posesi√≥n de estupefacientes) and ""serious assault and resisting arrest"" (ataques peligrosos y resistencia de particulares)."
