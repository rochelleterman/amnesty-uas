 Cambodia: Prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Kim Sen (Kim San); Meas Minear: These two human rights workers are to go on trial on 8 July 1999, charged with inciting demonstrators to use violence.  The charges      relate to riots in  the coastal town of Sihanoukville in  November 1998,       following the dumping of toxic       waste.  Amnesty International's own investigations have   found no evidence against them, and believes the charges  against them are politically motivated. They work for the Cambodian human rights group LICADHO (Cambodian League    for the Promotion and Defence of Human Rights) and if     convicted, they would be considered prisoners of          conscience.
