 Iran: Music journalists among those held in Iran | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Behrang Tonekaboni, a male music journalist, and his mother Lily Farhadpour, along with Behrang Tonekaboni’s male colleague Kayvan Farzin, have been detained at an unknown location since their arrests in Iran’s capital, Tehran, earlier this month. They appear to have been subjected to enforced disappearance and are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. The reason for their arrests is unknown, although it may be connected to the ongoing protests against the government in Iran. "
