 USA (Oklahoma): death penalty: Robert Brecheen | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Robert Brecheen, white, is scheduled to be executed in Oklahoma on 11 August 1995. He was sentenced to death in 1983 for the murder of Marie Stubbs, a prominent local resident, in 1983. The attorney at his original trial had given an affidavit dated 11 July 1995 in which he states his belief that Robert Brecheen did not receive a fair trial and acknowledges that his own inexperience in handling capital cases may have been a factor. Brecheen's current attorneys have raised questions about two jurors who may not have been impartial."
