 The 15 political prisoners, all men, who started a hunger strike at Insein prison on 26 October, ended their protest on 7 November without achieving their objectives. Recent information suggests that many of the men were denied drinking water during at least some of that period. A new hunger strike started in Insein prison on 10 November, this time by six political prisoners who were in the prison hospital. "
