 Guatemala: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of Sara Poroj and Sergio Rivera, who work for the Exhumations Programme of human rights organization Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo (GAM), Group of Mutual Support. They have been intimidated and threatened, in what appears to be an effort to stop their work to exhume secret mass graves.
