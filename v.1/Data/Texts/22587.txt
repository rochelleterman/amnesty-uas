 Saudi Arabia: Shi'a cleric at risk of torture: Sheikh Tawfiq Jaber Ibrahim al-‘Amr  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Saudi Arabian Shi’a cleric Sheikh Tawfiq Jaber Ibrahim al-‘Amr was arrested on 27 February following a sermon he gave calling for reforms in Saudi Arabia. He has been detained incommunicado since and is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Amnesty International is concerned that he may be held solely for the peaceful expression of his right to freedom of expression and may therefore be a prisoner of conscience."
