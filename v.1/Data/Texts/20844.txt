 Human rights lawyer Wei Liangyue and his wife Du Yongjing were detained on 28 February in the city of Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, reportedly for attending a Falun Gong meeting. They are currently held at Nangang District Detention Centre in Harbin. The authorities have warned the family not to discuss the case publicly and not to hire a lawyer to represent them. Amnesty International believes they are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment."
