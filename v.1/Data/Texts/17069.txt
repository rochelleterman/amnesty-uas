 Iran: Arbitrary arrest/torture | Amnesty International 
 The seven named men, and at least 130 others, all members of Iran's Arab minority, were arbitrarily detained between 15-18 April, and are at risk of torture. They were detained or around the city of Ahvaz, south-western Iran, after protests about the government's supposed plan to disperse or dilute the country's Arab population. They are not known to have been charged, or to have had access to legal representation, their families or any medical treatment.
