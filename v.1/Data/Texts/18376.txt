 Fear of torture or ill-treatment / Incommunicadon detention/ Possible prisoner of conscience

 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that Muhanna bin Abdul 'Aziz al-Hubail may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment as he is believed to be held in incommunicado detention in the city of al-Ihsa, Eastern Province. He may be detained solely for the non-violent expression of his political views and as such would be considered a prisoner of conscience.
