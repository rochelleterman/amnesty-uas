 Tanzania: Further information on Ill-treatment of government opponents - widespread arbitrary beatings and arrests of opposition   party supporter (James) | Amnesty International 
 Since April there have been far fewer arbitrary beatings  of supporters of the Civic United Front (CUF) opposition  party on Zanzibar. In April police beat more than 300 CUF supporters, one of whom is reported to have died as a     result. Neither the Zanzibar government nor the Tanzanian (Union) government has responded to Amnesty               International's appeals.All those who were arrested and   charged with ""vagrancy"" or other criminal offences have   been released on bail. No trials have been scheduled yet.
