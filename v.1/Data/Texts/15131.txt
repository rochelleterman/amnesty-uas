 The above-named are among political prisoners reportedly beaten by prison guards and gendarmerie on 14 September 1992 after they had refused to leave the exercise yard of Buca Closed Prison in Izmir. The prisoners were protesting against a reduction in their exercise period. In addition to the beatings, the prisoners' belongings were allegedly destroyed and money and valuables taken. The prisoners were allegedly beaten again on the night of 15 September. Since then more than 100 prisoners have been on hunger-strike in protest at the ill-treatment. Fourteen of the hunger-strikers are in a serious condition. "
