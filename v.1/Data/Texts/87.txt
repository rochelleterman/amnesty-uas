 Angola: Arbitrary arrest/ possible prisoner of conscience: Raul Danda (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 On 29 September, journalist and human rights defender Raul Danda was arbitrarily arrested by members of the Provincial Criminal Investigative Police on his arrival at the airport in Angola's Cabinda province. He has been charged with instigating, inciting and condoning crimes against the security of the state, which carry a penalty of a total of four years' imprisonment. Amnesty International is concerned that he appears to be a prisoner of conscience, arrested solely for his peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression and his membership of banned human rights organization Mpalabanda - Associaà®o CÁvica de Cabinda.
