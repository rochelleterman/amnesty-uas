 Iraq: Death penalty/ torture/ legal concern | Amnesty International 
 Six named men were sentenced to death by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq (CCCI) on 12 October 2006 for their alleged involvement in the kidnapping of three Romanian journalists in Iraq. The trial, which considered the case of all six defendants at the same hearing, is reported to have lasted about one hour. All six defendants face execution if the Court of Cassation upholds the CCCI's verdict. The men were reportedly tortured and threatened in detention, and Amnesty International believes that they did not have a fair trial.
