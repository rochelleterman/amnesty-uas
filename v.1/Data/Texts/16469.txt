 Besim Sokol Rama, Avni Smajl Nura, Osman Sokol Rama - ethnic Albanians: On 4 October 1996 the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that Besim Rama and Avni Smajl Nura had been arrested on charges of ""terrorism acts"". Amnesty International still does not know what the present situation of Osman Rama is. AI is concerned about the apparently incommunicado detention of Besim Rama and Avni Smajl Nura following arrest.
