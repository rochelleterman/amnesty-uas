 Egypt: Egypt's president must halt execution: Atef Rohyum Abd El Al Rohyum | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 An 34â€“year-old Egyptian man, Atef Rohyum Abd El Al Rohyum, is at imminent risk of execution. He was sentenced to death for murder in July 2005, along with a woman, Jihan Mohammed Ali. Jihan Mohammed Ali was executed on 10 March 2010, and Atef Rohyum Abd El Al Rohyum could therefore be put to death at any time. Egypt's President has the power to halt the execution."
