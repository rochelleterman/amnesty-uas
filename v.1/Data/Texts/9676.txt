  On 11 June 2007 a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled 2-1 that ""military detention of al-Marri must cease"" as ""the President lacks power to order the military to seize and indefinitely detain"" him.   As someone legally residing in the USA, he was entitled to certain constitutional protections, including the right to habeas corpus and due process.
