 Yemen: Fear of forcible return/Fear of Torture and Ill-Treatment | Amnesty International 
 Three Iraqi nationals, Ahmed Salman al-Zubaidi (m), Ahmed Muthana al-Aani (m), and Mohammed Mehdi al-Kana, who are believed to have been working as teachers in Yemen since 2002, were arrested in March 2003 in connection with alleged plans to attack the American and British embassies in the capital, Sana'a, and are alleged to have been agents of the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein. They have been acquitted of all charges, but are now in danger of being forcibly returned to Iraq, where they would be at risk of torture and ill-treatment.
