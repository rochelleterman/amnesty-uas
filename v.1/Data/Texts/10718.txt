 According to a recent detailed report, a group of Christians were reportedly severely beaten by local Public Security (police) officers, as a result of which a 22-year-old man, Lai Manping, died. The incident occurred on the evening of 27 March 1993 in the village of Taoyuan, Lijia township, in Xunyang county of Shaanxi province, when eight or nine police officers broke into a religious meeting. As many as 90 Christians are said to have been arrested in the area following the incident, and were still detained at the end of April. It is feared they may also be subjected to torture or ill-treatment. "
