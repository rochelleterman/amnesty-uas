 UA 60/94 - Cameroon: legal concern / prisoner of conscience / health concern: Janvier Deny | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Janvier Deny, a 32-year-old taxi driver and local section treasurer of the opposition party Union des forces democratiques du Cameroun (UFDC), Union of Cameroon Democratic Forces, was arrested on 12 January 1994 in Ebolowa, Southern Province. He is now being held in indefinite administrative detention. It is believed that he is a prisoner of conscience, and that his arrest may be part of an attempt by the authorities to intimidate opposition political parties before local government elections. There is also concern that his health has deteriorated since his arrest. He is reported to be suffering from malaria and diarrhoea. He was admitted to hopsital on 28 January, but despite his poor health, was returned to a police cell."
