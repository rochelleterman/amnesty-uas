 Egypt: Further information on torture / fear of torture / possible prisoner of conscience: Mohammad Wagdi Mohammad Durra | Amnesty International 
 Mohammad Wagdi Mohammad Durra was released on bail on 15 December 1996. He had converted from Islam to Christianity at the end of 1994, and had been arrested on 10 October 1996 accused of propagating information with the intention of causing insult to religions. Amnesty International is concerned that the charges against him have not been dropped and that he may still be tried solely on account of his conscientiously-held religious beliefs.
