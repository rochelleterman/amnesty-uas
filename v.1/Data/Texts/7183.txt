 There is concern at the reported extrajudicial execution of Jorge Solis and Eduardo Gomez following their abduction by members of the armed forces on 6 January 1994. According to reports, the two men were reportedly detained in the indigenous community of Las Margaritas, state of Chiapas, by members of the local police force, and taken to the municipal jail. The same day, witnesses saw them being taken from the jail by members of the army. They were not seen alive again. Their bodies were found in a ditch on the morning of 24 January. A forensic examination by the Attorney General's Office found that the two men had multiple stab wounds. Two representatives of the human rights organization, Physicians for Human Rights, were present at the autopsy and have verified the findings."
