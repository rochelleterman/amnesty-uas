 UA 282/92 - Afghanistan: Death penalty / fear of further executions: Sayed Sakander, Mohammad Gul, Mohammad Rafit | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned at the increase of the use of the death penalty after three men, Sayed Sakander, Mohammad Gul and Mohammad Rafit were publicly hanged on 7 September in Kabul after an Islamic court had found them guilty of robbery, looting and murder. According to reports in the international press the public had had no access to the trials and the men apparently were not given the right to appeal against their sentence to a higher court or to seek a pardon. A government spokesman declared that further executions may follow as similar cases were pending in court. "
