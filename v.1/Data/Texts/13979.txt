 Germany: Further information on fear of forcible repatriation / fear of torture: Fathelrahman Abdallah 

 | Amnesty International 
 On 12 November 1999, Fathelrahman Abdallah, the Sudanese  national who was detained in Nuremberg awaiting           deportation, was temporarily released. Amnesty            International remains concerned, however, that the        authorities will try to deport him again as soon as his   leave to remain expires on 22 November. He has been told  to report to the authorities on 19 November.
