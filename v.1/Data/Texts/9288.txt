 USA: Further information on the death penalty / Legal concern: James Edward DAVOLT | Amnesty International 
 On 21 April 2000, a jury in Mohave County, Arizona, found James Edward Davolt guilty of first degree murder. A date for the sentencing phase of the trial has not yet  been   set, but the defence has requested a delay so it can      investigate mitigating factors to argue against a death   sentence. The prosecution still intends to seek the death penalty   against James Davolt, in violation of           international law,  which forbids the use of this         punishment against defendants who were under 18 at the    time of the crime.
