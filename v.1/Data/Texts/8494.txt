"USA (Connecticut): Further information on Death penalty: Michael Bruce Ross (m) 
 NA 
 It is anticipated that a bill to abolish the death penalty will be introduced into the Connecticut legislature in the coming days. Governor Rell, in her announcement that she would not issue a reprieve to stop the execution of Michael Ross, white, aged 45, has said that she will veto any such legislation that is passed by the legislature (see previous update). A two-thirds majority in each chamber of the General Assembly (Senate and House of Representatives) is needed to be able to override a gubernatorial veto.
