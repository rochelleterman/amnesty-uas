 USA (Tennessee): Further information on Death penalty / Legal concern - Philip Ray Workman | Amnesty International 
 On 26 February 2001, the US Supreme Court denied Philip Workman's appeal requesting a hearing into evidence that has emerged since his conviction. Two days later, the Tennessee Supreme Court set a new execution date of 30 March. Amnesty International is shocked at the refusal of the state and federal courts to grant a hearing into the evidence, which severely undermines confidence in the original verdict.
