 Ethiopia:Further information on possible prisoners of conscience/fear of torture or ill-treatment/health concern | Amnesty International 
 In November 2005, police in Addis Ababa brought 24 people [including Hailu Shawel, Mesfin Woldemariam, Birtukan Mideksa, Berhanu Negga, Getachew Mengiste, Gizachew Shifferaw, Hailu Araya, Yacob Hailemariam, Debebe Eshetu, Muluneh Eyual, Daniel Bekele] to court and distributed a ""wanted"" list of 34 others. The court ordered the 24 to be detained for a further 14 days for police investigations into suspected violent conspiracy in connection with the previous week's demonstrations, although no one has yet been charged with any offence. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said that all 58 would be charged with treason. Amnesty International considers the 24 detainees in custody to be prisoners of conscience who have not used or advocated violence.
