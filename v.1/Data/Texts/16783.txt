 | Amnesty International 
 Egyptian national Omar Yahya Youssef, aged 23, was forcibly returned from Germany on 17 June. He boarded a plane to Cairo from Munich airport, but has not been seen since the plane landed. His uncle, who was waiting for him at the airport, was reportedly told that nobody had seen him. Amnesty International believes he has been detained by the Egyptian authorities, and is at great risk of torture or ill-treatment.
