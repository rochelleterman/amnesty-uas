 Russian Federation: Fear for safety, Stanislav MARKELOV (m), aged 29, human rights lawyer | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the safety of human rights lawyer, Stanislav Markelov, following a recent attack on him by a group of five men, whilst he was travelling on the Moscow metro. It is feared that he has been targeted for his work as a lawyer on behalf of victims in several key human rights cases, a number of which relate to the conflict in Chechnya.
