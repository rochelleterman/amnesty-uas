 Four Chilean prisoners who had been on hunger strike since 15 March 2011 have now ended their strike. Héctor Llaitul, Jonathan Huillical, José Hueniche and Ramón Llanquileo, who are of Mapuche ethnic origin, decided to stop their hunger strike on 9 June following a meeting with Concepción Archbishop. As a result of the meeting, a Commission for the rights of the Mapuche people was created. "
