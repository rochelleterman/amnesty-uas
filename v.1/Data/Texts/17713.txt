 EXTRA 108/92 - Israel / South Lebanon: deportation / fear for safety: over 400 Palestinians | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is seriously concerned about over 400 Palestinians deported from Israel and the Occupied Territories and currently stranded in an area between the ""security"" zone controlled by Israel with the South Lebanon Army and the rest of Lebanon. The Israeli authorities suspect most of the detainees of being members of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement. Hamas has claimed responsibility for the killing last week of an Israeli Border Policeman whom it had abducted. AI condemned the killing of Sergeant-Major Nissim Toledano but also called on the Israeli authorities not to retaliate for this killing by summarily deporting hundreds of Palestinians. "
