 There is concern for the safety of community leaders, opposition political party sympathisers, student activists and members of the Garcia-Mallorca Villareal family, following a wave of apparent extrajudicial executions in the town of Guamal, department of Magdalena. The victims were reportedly named in a death list drawn up in 1992 by members of paramilitary forces which include powerful local cattle-ranchers."
