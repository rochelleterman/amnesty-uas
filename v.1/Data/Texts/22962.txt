 Yemen/Gulf: Stop families suffering in the name of security: Web action: closing text | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The suffering of the families of those detained in the name of security continues, with no news of the fate of their loved ones, both at home and abroad. Governments in the region continue to detain individuals without charge or trial outside the rule of law. The Minister of Foreign Affairs in Yemen recently reported in the press that he expected that the US authorities would extradite some Yemeni nationals detained in Guantanamo Bay. Back in Yemen they could face further detention by the security forces."
