 Trinidad & Tobago: Imminent execution: Lester Pitman, (m) 

 | Amnesty International 
 The authorities of Trinidad and Tobago yesterday issued a warrant for the execution of Lester Pitman, aged 28. He is currently scheduled to be hanged on the morning of 13 June. Amnesty International is gravely concerned that a death warrant has been issued before Lester Pitman has exhausted all legal remedies available to him.
