 Iran: Further information on fear for safety/ medical concern/ incommunicado detention: Ahmad Batebi (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Former student activist Ahmad Batebi, aged 28, is now known to be held in Evin prison in the capital, Tehran. His relatives have been permitted to visit him there three times. He called off his hunger strike shortly after his family's first visit to him in detention on 21 August. However, he is still said to be seriously mentally and physically ill. Prison authorities are reportedly denying him access to the medical treatment he needs.
