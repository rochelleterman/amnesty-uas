 Another of those detained following violent incidents in North-West Province in late March 1997 is reported to have died of torture. Pa Mathias Gwei was arrested in Oku, Bui Division, but was transferred to Bamenda and held incommunicado at the headquarters of the Gendarmerie Legion. Although critically ill as a result of torture, he was reportedly denied medical treatment, and was finally admitted to hospital on 25 May 1997 where he died a few hours later. On 16 May forty-nine detainees were released, and a further twenty-one have since been released. An unknown number, however, are believed to be still detained incommunicado and several are reportedly in need of medical attention, including Zacharia Khan, a traditional medicine practitioner.
