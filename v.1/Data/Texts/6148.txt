 UA 51/94 - Guatemala: fear for physical safety: Mynor Vinicio Luna Lima | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Mynor Vinicio Luna Lima, who has been missing since 26 January 1994. He is the son of Miguel Angel Luna Gamboa, a businessman and President of the National Transport Coordinating Committee. On the day that he was last seen, the National Transport Coordinating Committee had declared a national strike. After his apparent ""disappearance"", his family filed a writ of habeas corpus, but the authorities have denied that he is being detained."
