On 18 February 1997 the Military Court of the General Staff in Ankara opened a trial against seven members of the Turkish Human Rights Association and five members, including Osman Murat Ulke, of the banned Izmir War Resisters' Association, on charges of ""alienating the public from the institution of military service"". This trial was adjourned to 1 April 1997. Amnesty International continues to call for Osman Murat Ulke's immediate and unconditional release as a prisoner of conscience.
