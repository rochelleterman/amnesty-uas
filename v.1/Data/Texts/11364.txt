 Baltasar SH Belo (20), Jose Maria Geronimo (32), Joao Budiono C Moraes (19), Gregorio Sequira Bento (16), Luis Afonso (22), Abel Fernandes (27), Armando C Soares (18), Bobby Xavier (23): At least eight, and possibly 13, East Timorese men have been arrested in the aftermath of two violent incidents in the East Timorese capital Dili, following the return of Bishop Carlos Belo. There is concern that the detainees may be tortured or ill-treated in custody. There is no information about the precise reasons for their arrest, but it is believed that they are being denied full access to independent legal counsel.
