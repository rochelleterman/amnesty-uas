 The nine people named above are reported to have ""disappeared"" after being arrested on 29 April 1994 by members of the security forces. They were detained at a playground in Kamenge, a suburb of Bujumbura, where local residents had been assembled. Those who have ""disappeared"" were apparently members of the Hutu ethnic group and Zairean nationals in the suburb, suspected of being in possession of arms."
