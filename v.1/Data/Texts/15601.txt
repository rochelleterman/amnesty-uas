 | Amnesty International 
 Ibragim Gazdiev, born 1978, who is an ethnic Ingush, was reportedly seized by armed men in camouflage, at about 12.54pm on 8 August in Karabulak, in the Russian Republic of Ingushetia. He has not been seen or heard from since   and according to unofficial information, is being held in incommunicado detention in Ingushetia or in a neighbouring North Caucasus republic. The authorities however have denied that Ibragim Gazdiev is being held in detention and Amnesty International fears that he is in real danger of being tortured or killed.
