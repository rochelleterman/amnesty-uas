 USA  (Missouri): Further information on Death penalty / Legal concern:  Antonio  Richardson | Amnesty International 
 The US Supreme Court is considering - through the case of Ernest McCarver - whether the execution of prisoners with mental retardation violates the US Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Antonio Richardson has the same issue before the court, and so his case is on hold pending the Court's decision. There is also a petition pending before the Court challenging use of the death sentence on the grounds of Richardson's age, 16, at the time of the crime.
