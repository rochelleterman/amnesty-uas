 Angola: Arbitrary arrest / torture | Amnesty International 
 Four men (Pedro Maria Ant¢nio, Paulo Mazungo), Andrâ      Conde & Domingos Conde) were arbitrarily arrested on 14   July by Provincial Criminal Investigative  Police         officers in the province of Cabinda. They had been        protesting against the appointment of a new bishop, and Amnesty International believes that they have been arrested solely for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression.
