 Iran: Prisoner of conscience/Fear of torture: Amir Yaghoub-Ali (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Amir Yaghoub-Ali, aged 20, an active member of the men's committee of the Campaign for Equality, was arrested on 11 July in Tehran. He had been collecting signatures in support of the Campaign, which aims to collect one million signatures from Iranians in support of an end to legalised discrimination against women. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression. Since his arrest he has been permitted to telephone his relatives once.
