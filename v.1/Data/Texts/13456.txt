 Vinoris Silva, Benedict Perera, Renuka Dhamayanthi (f), Ranil Krishantha (aged 10), Warnakulasuriyage Dinesh, Tennakoon Arachige Marie Teresa (f), Liyanage Lalith Chaminda, Liyanage Lalith Manchula (aged 3), Tennakoon Arachige Nicolas Appuhamy, Jayakody Arachige Marie Josephine (f), Gamage Sandya Malkanthi Perera (aged 15), Gamage Tilini Perera (f) (aged 13) and two others (unnamed): Members of the Liberation Tiigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are reported to have deliberately killed 14 Sinhalese civilians, including five women and four children, in the early hours of 11 June at Aruvakaly, north of Puttalam town. According to survivors, approximately 30 members of the LTTE armed with guns and machetes attacked the village. The villagers sought help at a police post in a nearby village but the police did not intervene. AI is concerned that Sinhalese civilians appear to have been deliberately and arbitrarily killed solely on the basis of their ethnicity.
