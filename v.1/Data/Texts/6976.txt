 UA 301/92 - Haiti: death threats / intimidation: Monsignor Willy Romulus, Father Alfred Doreseant | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI has received reports of recent death threats by members of the security forces against Monsignor Willy Romulus, Bishop of Jeremie, Grande-Anse department. On 24 September 1992, at about 1 am, an army sergeant and other heavily armed men reportedly called at the presbytery of the church where Mgr. Romulus was staying, demanding to see him and threatening him: they eventually left without seeing Mgr. Romulus but promised to come back. Mgr. Romulus has apparently been the subject of intimidation for some time. Father Alfred Doreseant, also from Jeremie, was reportedly beaten on 23 September 1992 by soldiers who accused him of carrying leaflets supporting ousted president Aristide. "
