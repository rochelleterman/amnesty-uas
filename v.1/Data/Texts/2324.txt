 AI remains concerned for the safety of Enoch Nzuza, regional organizer of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), member of the ANC and COSATU delegate at the local government negotiations forum in Mtunzini, KwaZulu-Natal, and members of his family. There have been further attacks on his family home and the police have apparently failed to investigate incidents which occurred earlier this year.  Nobody has been brought to justice for the attempted assassination of Enoch Nzuza and his brother Mandla Nzuza in February 1994."
