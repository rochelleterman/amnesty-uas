 The above men were released uncharged by the Bophuthatswana police on 18 August 1993. They had been on hunger-strike for two days in protest at their detention, but their health is reported to be satisfactory. They were not tortured or assaulted in custody. The police had confirmed that Thabo Sejanamane was detained under the terms of Bophuthatswana's Internal Security Act, and the other five also appear to have been held under its provisions, but no official reason has been given for their detentions. On 14 August during an attempt by the ANC to present a petition to the South African government's representative in Mafikeng, police arrested about 23 people and held them for approximately six hours before releasing them uncharged.
