 Tunisia: Fear of torture / legal concern: Tahir Zouinekh | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Tahir Zouinekh has been held incommunicado in an unknown place since his arrest in Gabes on 27 December 1994. This is far beyond the legal limit of 10 days permitted by Tunisian law. AI fears that he is at risk of torture or ill-treatment as long as he remains in incommunicado detention. His arrest appears to be associated with the fact that a family member who lives in Germany (where Tahir Zouinekh also resides) is a political refugee."
