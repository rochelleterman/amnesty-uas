 Tunisia: Fear of unfair trial: Mohamed Kilani | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Mohamed Kilani, a leading figure of the unauthorized Parti Communiste des Ouvriers Tunisiens, PCOT, was arrested around 29 January 1995. He is due to be tried in Gabes on 8 February 1995. AI fears that his trial may not be conducted in compliance with international fair trial standards. Mohamed Kilani had been in hiding since November 1992, when he was sentenced in absentia to 30 months' imprisonment on charges of belonging to an unauthorized association and of holding unauthorized meetings. He was also sentenced in absentia in January 1993 to 10 months' imprisonment on the same charges. Both trials violated international standards for fair trial."
