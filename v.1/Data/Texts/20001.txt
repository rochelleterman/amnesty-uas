 NA 
 Juan Juan Almeida, the son of a former leader of the 1959 Cuban revolution, has been refused permission to leave the country after he criticized the authorities. Amnesty International fears that the restrictions on his movement are a form of unnecessary punishment for exercising his freedom of expression and will continue to face harassment."
