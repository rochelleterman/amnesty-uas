 Fourteen of the above, including a pregnant woman, are reportedly being held in conditions which amount to ill-treatment. The women are being held in the Santa Monica Prison while the men are held in the Miguel Castro Castro Prison; most are members or staff of the officially-registered group Patria Libre. They were detained on 11 and 12 June 1992. All have reportedly been charged under new anti-terrorism laws of having links with the outlawed MRTA. One, Carlos Rivera Retis, has died in prison: he ws suffering from a renal infection.
