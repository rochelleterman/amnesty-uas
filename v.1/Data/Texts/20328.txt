 NA 
 Members of staff working at the Usumacinta Human Rights Centre (Centro de Derechos Humanos del Usumacinta, A.C) in the town of Tenosique, Tabasco state, southern Mexico, have been repeatedly threatened and intimidated. Amnesty International believes that these threats are in reprisal for their human rights work, particularly on migrants' rights. "
