 NA 
 Raj Kumar, aged 22, from Ludhiana, Punjab, has not been seen since he appeared at a press conference on 4 October 1994 in the presence of Ludhiana police who took him away. The police have denied that he is in their custody, and there are fears for his safety. He had been attending hearings in connection with a judicial inquiry after he had been unlawfully detained and tortured by Punjab police in August. Police have also reportedly made unsuccessful attempts to abduct two women, Rangilo and Bangarin, one of whom had been detained in August with Raj Kumar."
