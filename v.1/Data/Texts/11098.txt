 UA 61/94 - India: fear of torture / illegal detention: Sukhwinder Singh, Surjit Singh, Bhinda Singh | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern that Sukhwinder Singh, aged 20, his uncle, Surjit Singh, aged 60, and Bhinda Singh continue to be held in illegal detention where they are reportedly being subjected to torture. They were arrested by police on 13 February with five others, who have since been released. Bhinda Singh had also been released and reported that the other two were being tortured, but he has since been rearrested. Members of his family have reportedly gone into hiding for fear of police harassment."
