 UA 234/93 - Colombia: harassment / fear for safety: Members of Regional Human Rights Committee (CREDHOS) in Barrancabermeja | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Members of the Regional Human Rights Committee (CREDHOS), have again been the victims of threats and harassment by officials from the army's Nueva Granada Battalion, based in Barrancabermeja, Santander department. The latest attacks follow the issuing of a press release by CREDHOS on 27 May 1993 denouncing human rights violations committed by members of the Nueva Granada Battalion against the civilian population of Barrancabermeja. CREDHOS has frequently come under attack in recent years. Three members have been killed in circumstances suggesting they were extrajudicially executed, others have been subjected to serious death threats. Although the Colombian government has condemned the attacks, those responsible have not yet been identified and brought to justice. "
