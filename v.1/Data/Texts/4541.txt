 On 28 May 1995, the seven people referred to above were abducted from the villages of Ralito, Pueblo Bello and San Vicente del Congo, Uraba region, department of Antioquia. They were reportedly abducted by a paramilitary group. There is serious concern for their safety. These ""disappearances"" follow the exhumation, earlier this year, of several of the bodies of those believed to be victims of the Pueblo Bello massacre of January 1990, allegedly carried out by paramilitaries in collaboration with the armed forces."
