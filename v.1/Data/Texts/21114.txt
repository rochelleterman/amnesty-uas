 Two villages in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, have received an official notice that they will have to leave their homes within seven days, as a private company is redeveloping the site for tourism and commercial purposes. Around 160 families have been ordered to move from the area without adequate alternative housing or fair and just compensation being provided."
