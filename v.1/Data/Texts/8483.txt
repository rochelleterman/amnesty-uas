 USA (Iowa): Further information on death penalty: possible reintroduction of the death penalty | Amnesty International 
 A bill proposing the reintroduction of the death penalty in Iowa is likely to be debated and voted upon by the Iowa legislature in the immediate future. The state abolished the death penalty in1965. it appears that some have not yet decided how to vote and may be influenced by national and international lobbying.
