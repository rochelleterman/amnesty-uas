 People's Republic of China: Prisoners of conscience / health concern / torture/ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Liu Nianchun, labour activist, Zhou Guoqiang, lawyer, Gao Feng, Christian activist: There is concern at reports that Liu Nianchun, a labour activist from Beijing detained in Shuanghe labour camp, Heilongjiang province, has been tortured and placed in solitary confinement in harsh conditions after going on hunger-strike to protest against his imprisonment. He is reportedly in very poor health. Two other dissidents at Shuanghe camp, Zhou Guoqiang and Gao Feng, are also reported to have gone on hunger-strike to protest at increases in their sentences. Zhou Guoqiang is believed to suffer from tuberculosis, heart problems and nephritis. There is concern that these two men may also be subjected to punishments for this protest. All three men are considered to be prisoners of conscience.
