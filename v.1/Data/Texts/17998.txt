 Kuwait: Health concern / prisoners of conscience: at least 10 prisoners on hunger strike (names withheld) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 At least 10 prisoners of conscience in Kuwait Central Prison are reported to have been on hunger-strike since 14 February 1995. They are said to be protesting against their continued detention after manifestly unfair trials before the martial Law Court in 1991 and before the State Security Court in 1992. They are among 24 people charged with ""collaboration"" with the Iraqi authorities in connection with the much publicised al-Nida' newspaper case. AI is urging the Kuwaiti authorities to provide all necessary medical care to the prisoners and, as prisoners of conscience, to grant their immediate and unconditional release."
