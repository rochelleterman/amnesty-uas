 On 27 February 1994 the District Court of Pristina convicted all of the above defendants, with the exception of Ahmet Haxhiu and Rexhep Avdiu. Fifteen of the defendants were found guilty of conspiring to undermine by means of force Yugoslavia's territorial unity. Two other defendants were also convicted. The accused had all denied the charges against them, and most alleged that police had tortured or otherwise ill-treated them following arrest in order to obtain false, self-incriminating evidence from them. The defendants are appealing against their conviction, and pending appeal, Nehat Selimi, Islam Mulaku, Ajet Berisha, Sanie Aliu, Skender Hajdari and Hamit Zeqiri have been released."
