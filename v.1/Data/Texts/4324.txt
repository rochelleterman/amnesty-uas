 Further information has been received regarding Marisela Cardenas Bustamente, aged 13, who ""disappeared"" on 4 January 1994 in Remedios, Antioquia department. According to reports, the army's 14th Brigade, despite initial denials, have now admitted to holding Marisela Cardenas Bustamente, and have claimed that they handed her over to the state social services Institute. The Institute have also confirmed that they are holding her, but have denied all access to her. As a result there is still serious concern for her safety."
