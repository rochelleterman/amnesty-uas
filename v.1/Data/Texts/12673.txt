 Nepal: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/ prisoner of      conscience, Gagan Thapa | Amnesty International 
 Gagan Thapa, a student leader and former General Secretary of the Nepal Students' Union (NSU), was arrested on 27 July by security forces in plain clothes. He is reportedly being detained at the Hanuman Dhoka police station in the capital Kathmandu and is at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience, detained solely because he has peacefully exercised his right to freedom of expression.
