 Htay Kywe, Mie Mie, Aung Thu and Zaw Htet Ko Ko are believed to have been charged on 23 January 2008 with breaking a vaguely worded security law. They are being held in Yangonâ€™s Insein Prison, where they risk being tortured or ill-treated. Activist Hein Htet is also believed to be in detention.  However his whereabouts and that of the sixth person arrested are unknown. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience, held solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression and peaceful association. "
