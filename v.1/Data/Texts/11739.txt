 Indonesia: Fear for safety/intimidation | Amnesty International 
 Death threats have been sent to Suciwati, whose husband, human rights defender Munir, was poisoned in September, and to the human rights organisation he headed, Imparsial. Amnesty International believes the lives of Suciwati and the staff of Imparsial could be in danger. It is vital that the Indonesian government takes concrete measures to guarantee their safety immediately.
