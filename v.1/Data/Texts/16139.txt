 The above-named were placed under house arrest in Ashgabat, capital of Turkmenistan, during the weekend of 24-25 October 1992. The homes of Akhmukhamed Velsapar and Khudayberdi Khali were reportedly ransacked by police, who threatened the young children of one of them. All four are senior members of the opposition political movement Agzybirlik. They were placed under house arrest within hours of making contact with AI representatives visiting the country (and who were later expelled from Turkmenistan). AI believes the four to be prisoners of conscience who should be immediately and unconditionally freed. "
