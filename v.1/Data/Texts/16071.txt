 On 11 October 1993 the prosecuting team of the self-proclaimed Dnestr- Moldovan Republic (DMR) requested the death penalty for the above six men who are being tried by the DMR Supreme Court as a court of first instance, in Tiraspol. There is concern that the six men are not receiving a fair trial. Four say that their confessions were obtained under duress and have withdrawn them. Ilie Ilascu who did not sign a confession reports that he was subjected to mock executions in pre-trial detention in an effort to force him to confess. The court also refused a request to hospitalize Andrei Ivantoc, who is said to suffer from a serious liver disease, during a hearing on 5 May 1993. "
