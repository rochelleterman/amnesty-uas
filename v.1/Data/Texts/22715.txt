 Former prisoner of conscience Talal Abu Dan was arrested on 30 January 2008 by State Security officials in Aleppo city. He had attended the 1 December 2007 meeting of the pro-democracy umbrella group Damascus Declaration for Democratic National Change, and this appears to be why he was arrested. Like 11 others who also attended the meeting he is detained incommunicado and is at grave risk of torture."
