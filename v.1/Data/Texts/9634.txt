 EXTRA 106/93 - USA (Idaho): death penalty: Keith Wells (includes correction) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Keith Wells, white, aged 31, is to be executed in Idaho on 6 January 1994. He was sentenced to death in December 1990 for two murders committed during a robbery. He has reportedly relinquished his right to all appeals and dismissed his attorneys and wishes his execution to be carried out as soon as possible. AI opposes the death penalty unconditionally and is calling for the sentence to be commuted."
