 Israel: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Hundreds of thousands of civilians, particularly children, in south Lebanon are at risk from unexploded cluster bombs fired by Israeli forces during the 34-day conflict between Israel and Hizbullah prior to the ceasefire which took effect on 14 August. Israel has so far failed to respond adequately to UN requests to hand over maps detailing the areas it targeted with cluster bombs, which are needed to assist bomb clearance and so reduce the potential for further civilian casualties.
