 Egypt: Further information on incommunicado detention/ enforced disappearance/fear of torture/medical concern: Dia’ el Din Gad (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Dia’ el Din Gad was transferred to al-Qota Prison in Giza, on 24 February 2009. He is not known to have been charged with any offence, and is most probably held under an administrative detention order from the Minister of Interior, under the Emergency Law. Amnesty International considers Dia' el Din a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression, who should be released immediately and unconditionally.
