 Bangladesh: Fear for Safety: Members of the Ahmadiyya community in Dhanikhola village, Dhaka province

 | Amnesty International 
 An Islamist group has threatened to organise a rally in order to place a placard denouncing the Ahmadiyya religious community outside the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat mosque in Dhanikhola village, in Mymensingh, a district of Dhaka Province, on 10 February. This is the latest in a series of attempts by Islamist groups to prevent the Ahmadis from openly practising their beliefs. Amnesty International believes Ahmadis in the area may be at risk of violent attack.
