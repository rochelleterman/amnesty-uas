 On 21 August 1995 a third special appeal on behalf of the three men named above was rejected by Taiwan's Supreme Court. AI has written to the President and the Minister of Justice to appeal to them to prevent the executions. AI opposes the death penalty unconditionally in all cases. In this case, it is also concerned about allegations that the three defendants were reportedly tortured under interrogation and convicted on the basis of confessions extracted under torture."
