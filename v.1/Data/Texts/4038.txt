 AI is concerned for the safety of people working with the Catholic Church's Children's Pastoral in Sao Paulo, following a number of violent incidents and acts of intimidation since 12 December 1993. Jonathan Hannay (English) needed hospital treatment after trying to mediate in a dispute between the police and street children. (An 11-year-old child was also beaten during the incident). Since 12 December, two other street educators, Maria Cecilia Garcez Leme and Maria Ines Rondello, have been followed by military police and police have also reportedly visited Jonathan Hannay's house asking for his whereabouts."
