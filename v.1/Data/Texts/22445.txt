 NA 
 On 4 June 2009, the Israeli army destroyed the homes of 18 Palestinian families and their animal pens in the hamlet of Ras al-Ahmar in the OPT. The Israeli army confiscated the water storage tank that the villagers rely on as well as the tractor and trailer that they use to bring water to the village. The villagers are now without shelter or source of water during a season of high temperatures. "
