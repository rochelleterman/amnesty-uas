 There is concern for the safety of the eight lawyers named above from the Bar Association in Diyarbakir, who were all detained during the week of 15 November are said to be held at the Gendarmerie Headquarters in Diyarbakir. Under emergency legislation they may be held for up to 30 days and it is feared they are being interrogated under torture. The lawyers have acted as defence counsel in many political trials before Diyarbakir State Security Court, notably of defendants in PKK trials. According to Turkish legislation the gendarmerie do not have the legal authority to interrogate lawyers."
