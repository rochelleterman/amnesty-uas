 AI has received information concerning five prisoners on death row in St Lucia who may soon have their appeals for clemency denied. AI fears that the prisoners will face imminent execution if this should happen. These fears have been heightened by the first execution in St Lucia in nine years of Joseph Solomon. He was executed less than a month after his appeal was dismissed."
