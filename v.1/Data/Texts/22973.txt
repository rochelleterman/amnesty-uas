 Yemen: Further information: Southern movement leader detained: Hassan Ba’oom | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Hassan Ba’oom, a leader of a political opposition group in southern Yemen, has been held incommunicado detention since 20 February. Amnesty International fears for his health and is concerned that he may be held solely for the peaceful expression of his right to freedom of expression and therefore be a prisoner of conscience. "
