 Ukraine/Uzbekistan: Further information on fear of forcible deportation / fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that Muhammad Bekzhon, Yusif Ruzimuradov, Kobil Diyarov and Negmat Sharipov face an unfair trial after being forcibly returned to           Uzbekistan from the Ukraine. Amnesty International        believes the four may have been charged solely for their  relationship to Muhammad Salih, the exiled leader of the  banned democratic opposition party Erk.
