 Mostafa Evezpoor and his 14-year-old brother Mohammad Reza Evezpoor, both members of the Iranian Azerbaijani minority, were reportedly arrested two days before the start of the new academic year in Iran on 1 Mehr (23 September). Iranian Azerbaijani activists had called for a boycott of the first day of the school year and for demonstrations to be held calling for the right for Iranian Azerbaijani children to be educated in their own language. They are among more than 15 people reportedly detained before and after the boycott. All of those detained are at risk of torture and ill-treatment.
