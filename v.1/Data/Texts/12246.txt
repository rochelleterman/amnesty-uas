 Malaysian police have arrested another two opposition politicians and a human rights defender, bringing to ten the total number of detainees held under the Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows for indefinite incommunicado detention without charge or trial. They are being held in an unknown place of detention and denied access to their families and lawyers. They are all at grave risk of torture or ill-treatment.
