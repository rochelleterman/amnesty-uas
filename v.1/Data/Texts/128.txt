 Burundi: Fear for safety: Deogratias Sindaruhunga | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about reports that Deogratias Sindaruhunga, a Hutu, has been arbitrarily detained and transferred to a military camp in Bubanza province, where he may be at risk of torture and extrajudicial execution. He was reportedly arrested on 22 December 1994 while trying to separate two men who were fighting. The men, along with a bystander, took him to the local authorities who apparently held him for a few days before handing him over to soldiers. AI does not know if he has been charged. It it believed that he may be in military custody solely because of his Hutu ethnic origin."
