 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of human rights worker Wilfredo Sibayan who was arrested on 28 March 1994 and is currently believed to be held in incommunicado detention in Camp Aquino, San Miguel, Tarlac. He was arrested without a warrant by plainclothes members of an intelligence security unit of the Philippine Army. Over the last year he has received several death threats. There are also fears for his health as he suffers from high blood pressure and a kidney complaint."
