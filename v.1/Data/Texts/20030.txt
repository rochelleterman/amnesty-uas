 Johnny Rivas and his family are being intimidated by anti-migrant protestors as a result of his work as the coordinator of the Solidarity Associations of Migrant Workers in the Northwest Region (Asociaciones Solidarias de Trabajadores Migrantes de la LÃ­nea Noroeste, ASOMILIN). Amnesty International fears that an escalation in intimidation may lead to attacks on Johnny Rivas, members of his family or migrant workers, as occurred in October 2007."
