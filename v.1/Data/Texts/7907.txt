 Peru: fear of torture / prisoner of conscience / arbitrary detention: Magna de la Cruz Vasquez | Amnesty International 
 There is grave concern at the redetention on 28 February 1996 of Magna de la Cruz Vasquez, a social worker, by members of the Direccion Nacional Contra el Terrorismo (DINCOTE). She is a prisoner of conscience and it is believed she may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment while in police custody.
