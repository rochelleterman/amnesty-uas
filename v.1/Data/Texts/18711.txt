 'Ali Sayed al-Shihabi was visited by his family on or before 17 October. He appeared to be in good health. This visit was the first that his family had been allowed since he was detained by State Security agents in the capital, Damascus, on 10 August. On 10 October he was questioned by a judge at the Justice Palace in Damascus and transferred from the State Security centre at Kafr Soussa, Damascus, to 'Adra prison, just outside the city. His family is now allowed to visit him every Tuesday. 'Ali Sayed al-Shihabi may be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful expression of his views.
