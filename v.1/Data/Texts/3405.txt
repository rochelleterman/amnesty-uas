 Zaire: Fear of mass human rights violations on members of the Tutsi ethnic group and other civilians | Amnesty International 
 The deputy governor of Zaire's South-Kivo region announced on 8 October 1996 that all Zairian Tutsi in the region must leave their homes and relocate to temporary camps within one week. Amnesty International is concerned that mass arrests, severe ill-treatment, ""disappearances"", or even killings will increase and that anyone of Tutsi appearance will be victimized.
