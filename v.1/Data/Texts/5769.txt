 Ecuador: Fear for safety, Luis Bermeo Jaramillo | Amnesty International 
 An Ecuadorian provincial governor who opposes the US military aid program to neighbouring Colombia, known as Plan Colombia, escaped with his life when a hand grenade was thrown at his car yesterday morning by men believed to be Colombian paramilitaries. Luis Bermeo Jaramillo is now in hospital. The authorities have not properly investigated previous death threats against him, and Amnesty International is concerned that his life is in grave danger.
