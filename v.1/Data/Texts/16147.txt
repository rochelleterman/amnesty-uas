 Turkmenistan: Prisoners of conscience/ill-treatment: Vepa Tuvakov (m) and Mansur Masharipov (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Prisoners of conscience Vepa Tuvakov and Mansur Masharipov were recently jailed for refusing military service on religious grounds. The Turkmen authorities have recently taken measures to avoid being classified as a ""country of particular concern"" under the United States' International Religious Freedom Act, which could lead to trade sanctions, and Amnesty International believes that international pressure now could secure the men's release. They are at risk of beatings and other ill-treatment in detention.
