 Ethiopia: Forcible return/ fear of torture or ill-treatment/incommunicado detention/ prisoner of conscience | Amnesty International 
 On 27 September 2007, the Sudanese authorities forcibly returned 15 recognised refugees, among them Atanaw Wasie, to Ethiopia. They were handed into the custody of Ethiopian security personal at the Ethiopia-Sudan border. Their current whereabouts in Ethiopia is unknown, and Amnesty International believes they are now at risk of enforced disappearance, arbitrary and incommunicado detention, torture and unfair trials.
