 NA 
 The five people named above have been detained under temporary emergency regulations governing ""unrest areas"" in black townships in the ""Vaal Triangle"" south of Johannesburg. Three of them are active in the Youth League of the ANC and one is a member of the South African Communist Party. Morris More and 16-year-old Victor Radebe were arrested on 9 September 1992; both were allegedly assaulted at the time of arrest. Morris More is being held in solitary confinement, in apparent contempt of a bail order. Victor Radebe is still held in Vereeniging Police Station, as are the other three, who were arrested in November 1992. AI is concerned that all five have been arbitrarily detained; the organization is also concerned about their physical welfare. "
