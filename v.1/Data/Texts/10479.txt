 The nine young people named above, who were arrested at the funeral of U Nu on 20 February 1995, were sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on 28 April 1995. Although they were present at the funeral and delivered a eulogy on U Nu, they were not attempting to demonstrate or make any overt political statement. They are prisoners of conscience."
