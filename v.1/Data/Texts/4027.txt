 Frei Anastacio Ribeiro was detained on 27 November 1995 by Federal Police agents in the north-eastern state of Paraiba. He has reportedly been charged with ""forming a criminal ganag"", with inciting land occupations and with ill-treating children. AI is concerned that his detention and this use of the charge may be part of what appears to be a pattern of harassment of those campaigning for land reform."
