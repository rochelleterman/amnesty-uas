 Mexico: Further information on fear for safety/use of excessive force/ fear of torture/ ill-treatment/Arbitrary detention | Amnesty International 
 At least five demonstrators and one US journalist were killed in Oaxaca City between 27 and 29 October, when thousands of federal security personnel entered the centre of the city to control protests. Scores of other protestors were arrested in the security operation. However, the authorities have so far failed to make public the identities of those in detention, where they are being held and the charges they face.
