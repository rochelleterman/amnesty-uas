 Azerbaijan: Prisoner of conscience/ Fear of torture or ill-treatment: Mushviq Mammedov (m) | Amnesty International 
 Mushviq Mammedov was detained on charges of evading the draft for military service on 28 April. As a Jehovah's Witness for six years, his religious beliefs prohibit him from performing military service. He is currently detained in Bayil Prison, Baku, where he may be at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Amnesty International considers Mushviq Mammedov to be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely because of the peaceful exercise of his religious beliefs.
