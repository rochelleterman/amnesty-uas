 Dean Edwardo Vasquez, aged 26, is scheduled to be executed on 30 October 1992. He was sentenced to death by hanging by the Supreme Court of Belize on 21 June 1991 for the murder of his common-law wife in 1990. All legal appeals made on his behalf, including to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, have been rejected. AI notes that this would be the first execution in seven years in Belize; the organization is appealing for the sentence to be commuted. "
