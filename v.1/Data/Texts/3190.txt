 Police arrested about 30 people on 29 October 2007 and tortured at least 22 of them, including Geoffrey Oyuru, Denis Coto, Patrick Opono, Joshua Ocen, Tom Ekwang, Alfred Ebong, Geoffrey Ebong and Emmanuel Abak. The detainees had allegedly stolen and killed 80 cattle, and shot and wounded one man, the previous day. They are now in danger of further torture. They have no legal counsel, and have not received adequate medical care, though at least four of them have serious injuries.
