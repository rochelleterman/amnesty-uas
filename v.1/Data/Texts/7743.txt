 Paraguay: Fear for safety/Death threat | Amnesty International 
 Two nuns and a community leader from Naranjito, General ResquÁn District, San Pedro Department, in the north of Paraguay, received anonymous death threats on 4 and 5 August. The threats appear to be linked to their work on behalf of peasant communities and Amnesty International is concerned for their safety as Josâ Bord¢n has been threatened in the past due to his work for land reform.
