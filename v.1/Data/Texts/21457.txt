 NA 
 At about 10 pm on 27 May 2008, Isa Khalitov was reportedly detained by armed men in camouflage near the village of Goragorsk in the Chechen Republic. He has not been seen since and his family fear that he is being held in incommunicado detention by the police. Amnesty International is concerned he is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment."
