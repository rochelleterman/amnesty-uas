 South Africa: Shelter under threat | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Since 2004, the Sinethemba Shelter for Domestic Violence Victims, the only lodging of its kind in the south coast region of KwaZulu-Natal province, has offered survivors of domestic violence a temporary haven. However, its work may come to an abrupt halt because the existing shelter house, which Sinethemba has been renting, has been put up for sale and all attempts to secure larger, permanent premises in the same community have so far proved unsuccessful.
