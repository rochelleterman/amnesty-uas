 Colombia:  Fear for Safety for  forcibly displaced        civilian communities | Amnesty International 
 Paramilitary forces have threatened to attack an          internally displaced community, whose members have sought refuge in , if they do not leave immediately. In          light of the authorities' continued failure to combat     paramilitarism and to protect civilians in the region,    Amnesty International believes the displaced community is in grave danger. The organization is particularly         concerned for the safety of displaced community leaders,  who have been accused of working for guerrilla groups.
