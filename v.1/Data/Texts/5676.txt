 UA 316/92 - Ecuador: fear of refoulement: Oscar Amaris | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about the possible refoulement (forcible return) of Oscar Amaris, a Colombian political refugee, from Ecuador to Colombia. He and another Colombian citizen were reportedly detained on 7 October 1992; the other Colombian was released after 24 hours. AI is appealing to the authorities not to return Oscar Amaris to Colombia, where he may be at risk of serious human rights violations. "
