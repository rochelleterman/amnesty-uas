 Ayatollah Sayed Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi was hospitalized in the medical facility of Yazd Prison on 17 May 2009. This was after he began a hunger strike on 5 May to protest against the suspension of his rights to make telephone calls to his family and lawyer and to receive visits from them. Amnesty International fears that the prison clinic may not provide all the medical attention he needs."
