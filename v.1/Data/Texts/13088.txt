 Philippines: ""Disappearance"" / fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Nicolas Ruiz, lawyer, Jevee Patalita, driver: There is grave concern for the safety of the above men, who were abducted by unidentified armed men from a restaurant on 12 July 1997. Attorney Ruiz had been acting as counsel for a person believed to be the leader of a criminal syndicate involved in drug-trafficking and there is concern he may be at risk of torture in order to force him to release confidential information about his clients. A petition for habeas corpus was filed before the Supreme Court, but government agencies have denied his detention. In response to a planned boycott of the courts by the Integrated Bar of the Philippines in protest, President Ramos is reported to have ordered an investigation.
