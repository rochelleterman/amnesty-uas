 The judge of the 5th criminal circuit of Bogota has ordered the QAP television station and all other media organizations to refrain from publishing details of a list of people and institutions considered by military intelligence to be collaborators or supporters of guerrilla organizations. The list, which contains information officially deemed unreliable, was passed to QAP in August 1993. There is grave concern that publication of the list would put the lives of those named at serious risk. The Andean Commission of Jurists is seeking to revise the latest judgement and has asked the People's Defender to take the matter before the Constitutional Court."
