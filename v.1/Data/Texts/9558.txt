 USA (Pennsylvania): Death penalty / Legal concern - Steven A. Pannebaker, (m), white, aged 16 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that the Juniata County District Attorney in Pennsylvania may seek the death penalty at the forthcoming trial of Steven Pannebaker. The defendant was 16 years old at the time of the crime of which he is accused. International law, respected in almost every country in the world, prohibits the use of the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime.
