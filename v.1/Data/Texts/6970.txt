 UA 281/92 - Haiti: Fear of ""disappearance"" / ill-treatment: Wilson Sincere, Mousson Romero, Alix Mondesir | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned at the reported arrest of Wilson Sincere, a teacher, by uniformed members of the security forces in Port-au- Prince on 25 August 1992; and at the abduction of Alix Mondesir, Assistant Secretary General of the September 17 Popular Organization (OP17) by armed men in civilian clothes on 26 August 1992. The authorities deny holding them and there are fears that they may ""disappear"". Amnesty International is also concerned for the safety of Mousson Romero, an ironworker, who sent a note to his family from a detention centre in Port-au-Prince but whose detention has reportedly been denied by the authorities.
