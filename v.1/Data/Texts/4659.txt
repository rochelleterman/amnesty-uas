 Colombia: Fear for safety: Father Ezio Guadalupe Roattino Bernardi | Amnesty International 
 There is concern for the safety of Italian priest Father Ezio Guadalupe Roattino Bernardi, who is working in the community of Caldono, department of Cauca, following reports that the Police Commander of Cauca Department has labelled him a guerrilla sympathizer and collaborator. In the past many of those labelled thus have subsequently become the victims of human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions, at the hands of the security forces or their paramilitary allies. According to Father Ezio he has already been the victim of a failed attempt on his life following these allegations.
