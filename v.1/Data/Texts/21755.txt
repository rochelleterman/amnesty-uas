 Bahrain: Adequate housing urgently needed | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A lack of adequate temporary housing in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) means that women who choose to leave the marital house or remain in abusive relationships because they have nowhere else to go have little opportunity to seek redress in a secure and safe environment.  There are no government-supported shelters, and those few provided by charitable organizations and some embassies are often only able to offer limited help.
