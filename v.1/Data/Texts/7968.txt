 Peru: Prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 The case of Julia Rodrçguez Suarez will be heard in the Supreme Court on 22 May. Amnesty International fears that she will be detained when she appears in court, in which case she would be a prisoner of conscience. On 10 May, the Supreme Court overturned the order to detain Herminio Palomino Soto, replacing it with an order to appear before the Supreme Court when his case is heard. It is not known when this will be, but he is now at liberty.
