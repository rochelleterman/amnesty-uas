 Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories/Egypt	: Further Information on Medical Concern | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Nufuz Husni, who has cancer, has now received authorization from the Israeli authorities to seek medical treatment in the Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv. On 22 October the Israeli Minister of Defence, Ehud Barak, imposed a total closure on Gaza in response to a home-made projectile fired from the Gaza Strip. However, it is hoped that, in view of her serious medical condition, Nufuz Husni will be able to leave as arranged on 24 October. All the other above named patients, most of whom have been referred to hospitals in Egypt, have not yet received authorization to leave Gaza for medical treatment."
