 Sweden/Egypt: Forcible Return/ Risk of Torture, Muhammad Muhammad Suleiman Ibrahim El-Zari, Ahmed Hussein Mustafa Kamil Agiza | Amnesty International 
 The Swedish authorities forcibly returned the two Egyptian asylum-seekers named above on 18 December, after rejecting their asylum claims in an unfair procedure. In Egypt they are at grave risk of torture and unfair trial. The men's whereabouts are unknown and they are feared to be held incommunicado. Both have said that they have been tortured while detained in Egypt in the past.
