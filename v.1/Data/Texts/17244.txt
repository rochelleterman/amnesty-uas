 Iran: Further information on medical concern/ possible prisoners of conscience/ fear of torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Sakina Naisi was reportedly taken to a hospital in Ahvaz earlier this month after suffering blood loss, possibly caused by torture and ill-treatment. Another Arab woman, Hoda Hawashemi, was reportedly arrested at her home in Ahvaz on 1 April, together with her two young sons. Amnesty International believes that these two women and the other six women and children (including Ma'soumeh Ka'bi (f), aged 28; her son Imad, aged 4; Soghra Khudayrawi (f); her son Zeidan, aged 4; Sakina Naisi (f), aged 40; Hoda Hawashem (f) aged 24 and her sons Ossama, aged 2 and Ahmad, aged 4) are most probably held solely in an attempt to force their husbands and fathers to give themselves up to the authorities. As such they would be prisoners of conscience.
