 Iraq: Further information on death penalty / fear of imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Shihab Ahmad Khalaf's (m) family are now known to have been able to speak to him by telephone in September 2006. When they have tried to contact him since then, however, they have been told that he has been transferred to another prison, and given no further information. There has been no news at all of 'Abdullah Hana Hermaz Kelahah (m). Amnesty International is concerned that the two men remain at risk of imminent execution.
