 On 24 September 1993 human rights activist Lily Maribel Olano Elera was reportedly arbitrarily detained by police near Picsi prison in Chiclayo, Chiclayo province, department of Lambayeqye. There is concern she may be falsely charged under Peru's anti-terrorist legislation. She is currently detained at the Women's police station of Chiclayo under investigation on suspicion of terrorism-related crimes. "
