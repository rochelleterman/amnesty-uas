 Côte d'Ivoire: Trade unionist arrested, at risk of torture | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is very concerned about the safety of Basile Mahan Gahé, a trade unionist who has been detained without charge at a police station in Abidjan’s Williamsville neighbourhood, Côte d’Ivoire, since 26 April. Amnesty International believes he may be a prisoner of conscience, solely detained for his political views and because of his alleged links to former President Laurent Gbagbo’s government."
