 UA 239/94 - Brazil: possible extrajudicial execution / fear for safety: Reinaldo Guedes Miranda, Hermogenes da Silva Almeida Filho and other human rights workers | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern at the possible extrajudicial execution on 13 June 1994 of Reinaldo Guedes Miranda and Hermogenes da Silva Almeida Filho, political activists and human rights activists. They were found shot dead in their car in the Cachambi area of Rio de Janeiro. They were advisers to the Partido de Trabalhadores (PT), Workers' Party and members of the Human Rights Commission of the local council, which had been closely following the investigation into the Candelaria and Vigario Geral massacres. Their deaths have heightened fears for the safety of other human rights workers, including those involved in investigating previous massacres."
