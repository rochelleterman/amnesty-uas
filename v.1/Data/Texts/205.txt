 AI is concerned that the Burundi army is using unrestrained lethal force in Bujumbura and that it may be extrajudicially executing hundreds of unarmed civilians. The latest round of killings began on 21 March 1994. There are reports of hundreds of civilians, including children and babies, being killed in fighting between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu armed civilians."
