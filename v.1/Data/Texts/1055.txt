 Cote d'Ivoire: Fear for safety/ Death threats | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of the two human rights defenders named above. Both are members of Mouvement Ivorien pour les Droits de l'Homme (MIDH), the Ivorian Movement for Human Rights and have been subjected to acts of intimidation and death threats. It is feared that the men are being targeted in an attempt to silence independent voices which call for a respect for human rights in Cªte d'Ivoire.
