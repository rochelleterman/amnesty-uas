 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Metin Toprak and Musa Ozsat, Democracy Party (DEP) candidates, and Nebahat Akkoc, DEP member and Diyarbakir branch president of the teachers' union Egit-Sen. They were detained by police after a raid on their houses during the night of 12/13 February 1994. The reason for their arrest is unknown. Under emergency legislation they may be held for up to 30 days and there is concern they may be subjected to torture during interrogation in police custody in Diyarbakir. There is particular concern for Nebahat Akkoc, whose husband, Zubeyir Akkoc, was shot dead on the street on 13 January 1993 in Diyarbakir."
