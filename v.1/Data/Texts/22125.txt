 Iran: Arbitrary arrest / Fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Reportedly, at least 25 employees of the newspaper Kalameh Sabz were arrested at its office in the capital Tehran on 22 June 2009. Kalameh Sabz, established by presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi in 2009, has not been published since 14 June. Five women were released shortly afterwards but the whereabouts of those still detained are currently unknown: they are feared to be at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Amnesty International believes all the detained staff members are prisoners of conscience, held solely on account of the peaceful expression of their views."
