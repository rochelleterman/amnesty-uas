 Iran: Two Iranian filmmakers detained for months: Mohammad Ali Shirzadi and Ja’far Panahi  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Two Iranian filmmakers – Mohammad Ali Shirzadi and Ja’far Panahi – are detained without charge or trial in Evin Prison, Tehran after their arrest in January and March 2010 respectively. Amnesty International is calling for their immediate and unconditional release as they are held solely for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression and are considered to be prisoners of conscience."
