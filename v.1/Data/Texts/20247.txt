 Three leaders of a protest against high electricity bills have been detained ever since a protest in southeast Mexico. In the next few weeks a judge will decide whether their detention and prosecution should continue. They are prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression."
