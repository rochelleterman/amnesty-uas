 | Amnesty International 
 Iranian Azerbaijani student Asgar Akbarzadeh was reportedly released on 21 December on bail of 70 million Rials (over US$7,500) by Branch 14 of the Revolutionary Court in Ardebil. The charges against him are believed to include ""propaganda against the system"", which relates to his copying, compiling and distributing leaflets about a demonstration that had been planned for 23 September, the first day of the Iranian academic year, demanding education be delivered in Azerbaijani Turkic. He is also awaiting the verdict in a trial on a separate matter.
