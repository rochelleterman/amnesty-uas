 UA 228/93 - Cambodia: extrajudicial executions of ethnic Vietnamese (includes correction) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is grave concern at confirmed reports of extrajudicial executions of 12 ethnic Vietnamese civilians by forces of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK, or Khmer Rouge) in Kompong Chhnang Province, central Cambodia, in four separate incidents from 8 to 11 July 1993. Five other deaths have been attibuted to them, but these have not been confirmed. Similar massacres have occurred in late 1992 and early 1993, and almost 200 Vietnamese civilians have now been killed. NADK commanders in the area have publicly stated that they will not tolerate the presence of Vietnamese in the Kompong Chhnang waterways. Local State of Cambodia (SOC) authorities have reportedly not investigated or condemned the massacres "
