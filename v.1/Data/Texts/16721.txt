 UA 346/94 - Egypt: death penalty / legal concern: Ahmed Muhammad Gumu'a, Sharif Mohammad Hassan (in absentia) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ahmed Muhammad Gumu'a and Sharif Mohammad Hassan (in absentia) were sentenced to death in Alexandria on 20 September 1994. Ahmed Muhammad Gumu'a could be executed within weeks if his sentence is upheld. The two men were charged, among other things, with membership of an illegal organization, International Jihad Organization, which reportedly aims to undermine the constitution by violent means. They were sentenced to death by a military court, even though they are believed to be citizens."
