 Prisoner of conscience Hojjatoleslam Hasan Yousefi Eshkevari's case was heard in a closed trial between 7 and 15 October. He has not yet been sentenced, but it is possible he could be sentenced to flogging or even the death penalty.
He has been       detained for two months  with  limited  access to his  family. The court reportedly rejected the  lawyers he had   chosen and would not let him carry out   his own defence.   Instead, he was appointed a lawyer not of his choosing."
