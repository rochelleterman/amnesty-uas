 NA 
 Duncan McKenzie is scheduled to be executed in Montana on 10 May 1995. He was sentenced to death in 1975 for the kidnap and murder of a female teacher. Before his trial, he was offered a prison sentence in exchange for a plea of guilty, which he accepted. However, despite the plea-bargain being approved by the trial judge, this offer was withdrawn after objections from the victim's family. Her mother is a state senator. At his trial, evidence of mental illness was not commented on by the judge who passed sentence."
