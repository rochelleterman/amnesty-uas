 Authorities in Mato Grosso do Sul state, western Brazil, have suspended the supply of basic food rations to the Dourados reservation, which is home to some 11,000 members of the Dourados Guarani Kaiowa indigenous community. Two children have already died of malnutrition, and another 36 children are reportedly in hospital. Scores of indigenous people, particularly children, are now at risk of starvation.
