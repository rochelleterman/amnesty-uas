 Gustavo Humberto Marroquin, aged 8, was reportedly shot dead by soldiers early on 11 March 1994. The army have said that the child was killed during an armed confrontation between the Jaime Rooke Battallion and members of the armed opposition FARC. However, on 18 March Alvaro Martin Pinzon broadcast reports from witnesses which claimed that the boy had been killed in cold blood. The same day, the Brigade commander demanded that copies of the witnesses' declaration be sent to the army base. There is serious concern for the safety of the boy's parents, Leonardo Marroquin Vargas and Luz Miryam Iglesias and for the fournalist, Alvaro Martinez Pinzon."
