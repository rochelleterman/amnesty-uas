 Colombia: Extrajudicial executions / fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 On 11 June 1998 two members of the Embera Katio indiginous community were killed when paramilitaries fired on the community indiscriminately. On 13 June two more members, Samuel Velasquez and Carlos Alberto Tanugama, were abducted by the paramilitaries and killed.  There is concern for the safety of the remaining members of the community most of whom are currently displaced or sheltering in the surrounding mountains.
