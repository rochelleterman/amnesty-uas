 Sharadha Shrestha, a Central Committee member of the      Women's Association (Revolutionary), was arrested in      Bharatpur, Chitwan District, southern Nepal on 25 July.   She has been held in incommunicado detention since then.  Guards at the army barracks where she is thought to be    held have suggested to Sharadha Shrestha's family that    she may have been tortured."
