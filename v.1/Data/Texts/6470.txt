 The above four members of the Sindicato de Trabajadores del Organismo Judicial (STOJ), Workers Union of the Judiciary, were reportedly detained on 27 May 1993 during a demonstration in Guatemala City. The demonstration outside the Supreme Court was in protest against measures announced by President Serrano on 25 May 1993. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and some people were beaten including those named above. They were then arrested, but their detention has not been acknowledged by the authorities, and their whereabouts are unknown. The rights to habeas corpus have been suspended. "
