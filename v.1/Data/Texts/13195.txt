 AI fears that Felipe Cabagsican Cabanting, a 24-year-old resident of barangay Durog, Leon, Iloilo, may have ""disappeared"" in police custody. According to reports, he was arrested by members of the Philippines National Police on 27 July 1992 and taken to Iloilo City Proper Police Station. However, inquiries made subsequently about his whereabouts reportedly met with denials that he was in police custody. It is believed that he was suspected of being a member of the outlawed New People's Army. "
