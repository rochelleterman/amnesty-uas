 Muhammad Dahman, Director of the Gaza Office of the human rights organization ""al-Damir"", was arrested on 12 August 1996 by the Palestinian Intelligence Service after having issued a communique calling for an investigation into alleged suicide after interrogation of Nahid Dahlan. Amnesty International considers Muhammad Dahman to be a prisoner of conscience. His case has been transferred to the State Security Court  where grossly unfair summary trials have been the norm.
