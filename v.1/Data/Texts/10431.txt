 NA 
 Khin Maung Oo and three others were sentenced to death on 10 January 1994 in Yangon (Rangoon). According to an official Myanmar radio broadcast, the four were given death sentences by a special court for the murder of a student, Maung Naing Win, on 8 January. There are fears that the four are in imminent danger of execution. There have been unofficial reports that students have met the First Secretary of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), to demand a public hanging. There is concern that the four may not have received a fair trial."
