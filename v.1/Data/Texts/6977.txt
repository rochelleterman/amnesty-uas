 UA 303/92 - Haiti: ill-treatment and possible extrajudicial execution: Jude Damus, Marcel Almonaty | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Jude Damus, aged 26, was reportedly arrested by soldiers on 10 September 1992, two days after an anti-government demonstration in Dame Marie. He was held at first in Anse d'Hainault prison where he was reportedly subjected to daily ill-treatment; during the first days of detention he suffered a broken arm. He was later transferred to the prison in Jeremie. AI is concerned about his reported ill-treatment and is seeking information about his legal situation. AI has also learned with concern of the killing of the former mayor of Anse d'Hainault, Marcel Almonaty, who had been forced to go into hiding after the coup of 1991. His body, bullet-ridden and with the eyes gouged out, was found in the sea at Anse d'Hainault on 25/26 September 1992. "
