 Sudan: Fear of torture / Prisoners of Conscience | Amnesty International 
 Abazar Ahmed Abu Al-Bashir (m) and Buthayna Mohamed Ahmed (f) have been arrested apparently because they have called on the Sudanese authorities to put an end to the conflict in Darfur, in the west of the country. They are at risk of torture. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful expression of their opinions.
