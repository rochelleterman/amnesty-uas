 Aleksei Sokolov, a male human rights defender, is unlawfully detained in the city of Yekaterinburg, near the Ural Mountains in Russia. The court order to keep him in pre-trial detention expired on 6 November and no further order has been issued. Amnesty International is concerned that the treatment of Aleksei Sokolov is aimed at putting him under pressure to withdraw from his human rights work. He remains at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. "
