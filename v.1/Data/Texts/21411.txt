 The 147 families of internally displaced people living in a temporary accommodation centre in the Chechen capital, Grozny, were reportedly told by officials on 10 January 2008 that they had to leave at short notice. The families include young children, elderly and disabled people, and they risk being forcibly evicted and being made homeless at a time when the temperature falls below freezing at night. "
