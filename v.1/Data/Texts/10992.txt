 On 1 September Liu Gang, prominent dissident and former prisoner of conscience, was sentenced to 15 days detention in Liaoyuan, Jilin Province, reportedly for breaching post-release conditions. AI considers him once again to be a prisoner of conscience and fears that he may be ill-treated in detention. The organization is also concerned that his arrest may be part of a campaign by the authorities to keep dissidents out of the way during the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women."
