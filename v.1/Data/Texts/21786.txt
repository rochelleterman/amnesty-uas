 NA 
 Two men are at imminent risk of being executed, after the National Safety Court of Appeal in Bahrain upheld their death sentences on 22 May. They were convicted with three other men of killing two policemen during anti-government demonstrations in March. Their trial was unfair. The two men could be executed within days if the sentences are upheld by the Court of Cassation and ratified by the King."
