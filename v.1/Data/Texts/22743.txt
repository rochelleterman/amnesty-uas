 Five protestors whose cases were included in the Urgent Action of 23 March were released on 24 March; two others remain in prison facing charges but are no longer held incommunicado. However, six detainees continue to be held incommunicado detention while the status and whereabouts of the remaining 79 is unclear; some or all may still be in detention. In addition, 49 other protestors are now also being detained incommunicado at unknown locations across Syria in connection with the recent protests, and are also now at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.
