 On 11 June 2008 Cristóbal Martínez Ortega, a municipal official from the village of San Antón, Cuernavaca municipality, Morelos State, was kidnapped by four men who identified themselves as police officers and was brutally beaten. Cristóbal Martínez is one of the leaders of a group of citizens opposing the construction of a landfill site in the area. Other members of this group may be at risk of similar attacks."
