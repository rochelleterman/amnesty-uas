 Venezuela: Possible extrajudicial executions / fear for safety / medical concern: At least 27 inmates, including one minor | Amnesty International 
 At least 27 inmates in La Planta prison in Caracas are reported to have died as a result of an attack by members of the National Guard on 22 October 1996. Tension in the prison, notorious for its appealing conditions, remains high in the aftermath of the killings, and Amnesty International is deeply concerned for the safety of those wounded in the attack and other inmates.
