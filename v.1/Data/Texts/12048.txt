 Republic of Korea (South Korea): health concern / fear of ill-treatment / prisoner of conscience: Park Yong-gil, (f), aged 75 | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Park Yong-gil, aged 75, was arrested on 31 July 1995 in South Korea for making an unauthorized visit to North Korea. Given her advanced age, AI is concerned for her health and fears that she may face ill-treatment and long interrogation by South Korea's intelligence agency, the ANSP. AI believes her to be a prisoner of conscience and is calling for her immediate and unconditional release. Park Yong-gil is the wife of Reverend Moon Ik-hwan, a prisoner of conscience who died in 1994. He was released in 1993."
