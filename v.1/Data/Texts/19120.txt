 Abderrahmane Hani was released on bail on 23 April 1994. He had been arrested on 15 February 1994 on charges of setting up an illegal organizations and spreading false information. There is concern that he awaits trial for having peacefully exercised his right to freedom of expression. Moncef Marzouki, arrested on 24 March, continues to be detained. He is a prisoner of conscience. The trial of Ahmed Kahlaoui, arrested on 4 March, began on 2 May 1994. Although it is not yet clear if he is a prisoner of conscience, there is concern that he may not be receiving a fair trial."
