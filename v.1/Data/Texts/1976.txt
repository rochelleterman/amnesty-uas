 Lieutenant-Colonel Chernor Deen, aged 55, formerly commander of the 2nd Battalion of the Republic of Sierra Leone Military Force, has been sentenced to death by a court martial in Freetown. He was dismissed from the army in April 1994, with 12 other senior officers. He was arrested in September 1994 and brought before a court martial in November, charged with collaborating with rebel forces. Defendants before a court martial have no right of appeal to a higher court but may submit a petition for clemency to a Committee of Mercy."
