 NA 
 Shortly before the execution of Barry Fairchild was due to be carried out on 22 September, a US District Court judge vacated his death sentence and ordered that his sentence be reduced to life without parole. An appeal for a summary reversal of this decision by the state of Arkansas was denied. However oral arguments on the merits of the state's appeal were ordered for the week of 11-15 October 1993. "
