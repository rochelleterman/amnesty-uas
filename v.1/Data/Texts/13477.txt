 Sri Lanka: Further information on extrajudicial execution / rape and new concern: fear for safety: Murugesupillai Koneswary (f), witnesses and neighbours | Amnesty International 
 According to media reports, in early June President Kumaratunga ordered an inquiry into the alleged extrajudicial execution and rape of Murugesupillai Koneswary on 17 May 1997. The inquiry has been entrusted to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a specialist unit of the police, and there is concern that they may not be seen as impartial. There is also concern that local police may threaten neighbours and other witnesses not to come forward. A post mortem was carried out at Kalmunai hospital, but the results are unknown.
