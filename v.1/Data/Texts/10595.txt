 China: Further information on Fear of Imminent execution/torture/ill-treatment/unfair trial | Amnesty International 
 Jur'at Nuri and Abduhalik Abdureshit have been sentenced to death, and Saydulla Kurban, Abdurazzak Jelil, Abdurazzak Shamseden, Elyas Jalal, Sultan Jalal, Hudiyumberdi Begzad, Haziritaly Adham, Tohtahun Yarmuhammed and Abdul Aziz Sawut to life imprisonment, by a court in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR). None has committed, nor was convicted of, any act of violence. Amnesty International believes that the sentences were passed after grossly unfair judicial procedures, based on confessions extracted under torture. All 11 remain at serious risk of torture in detention.
