 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Pravakar Subedi, a 20-year-old student, reported missing since 25 June 1993. Relatives believe that a photograph published in a national magazine, Surya, which depicts a man being carried away bleeding by police, may be of Pravakar. Police have told relatives that there is no record of his arrest or detention. "
