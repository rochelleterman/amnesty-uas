 Macedonia: Prisoner of Conscience. Zoran Vraniskovski (m), religious leader | Amnesty International 
 Zoran Vraniskovski, also known as Bishop or Metropolitan Jovan, is currently detained on remand for 30 days following his arrests on 12 January. He has been charged with ""causing national, racial or religious hate, discord and intolerance"" under Article 319 of the Criminal Code. Amnesty International believes that the reason for his arrest and detention is due to his support for the ecclesiastical control of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SOC) over the Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC) and considers him to be a prisoner of conscience.
