 Cambodia: Fear for safety: Srun Vong Vannak | Amnesty International 
 There are fears for the safety of Srun Vong Vannak, chief of security of the opposition Khmer Nation Party (KNP), who is being held in incommunicado detention at an unknown location. He was reportedly arrested on 14 February 1997 on suspicion of involvement in the murder of Kov Samuth, the brother-in-law of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, in November 1996. All attempts by his family, lawyers and human rights workers to gain access to him have been prevented by the authorities.
