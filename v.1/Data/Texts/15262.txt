 Further information has been received from lawyers and prisoners' relatives regarding the events in Diyarbakir E-Type Prison on 4 and 5 October. Inmates at the prison have reportedly been badly ill-treated while being taken to and from court. On 13 September 30 defendants, in chains, were beaten virtually unconscious, in full view of the prosecutor and defence lawyers. As a result prisoners refused to attend hearings and began a hunger-strike. On 4 October police were attempting to take M Erdogan Dincer for interrogation when fellow inmates, afraid he might be tortured, barricaded themselves in Dormitory 27. In the ensuing raid by soldiers, police and wardens, Ramazan Ozuak died from burns as mattresses caught fire. Inmates were then dragged away and beaten. A total of 306 prisoners were transferred to Gaziantep, again subject to repeated beatings. Injured prisoners in Gaziantep have allgedly not been given any medical treatment. Fifteen prisoners are said to have begun a hunger-strike in protest."
