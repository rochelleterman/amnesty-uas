 Saudi Arabia: Further information on Death Penalty/Fear of imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Sultan Kohail was sentenced to 200 lashes and one year's imprisonment on 5 April 2008, in connection with the murder of a Syrian boy who died in January 2007.  His sentence will be sent for review to the Court of Cassation, which can recommend that he be retried by a General Court. This court would have the power to sentence him to death, even though he is 17 years old.  He was arrested with his brother Mohamed Kohail and Jordanian national Mehanna Saâ€™d, who were sentenced to death in March. Both men have appealed to the Court of Cassation, and will be in imminent danger of execution if their appeals are rejected."
