 Cambodia: Fear of imminent forced eviction | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 23 April 2009, the Phnom Penh Municipality distributed a final eviction notification to a community of around 80 families known as Group 78. It is the sixth eviction notice issued to the community since 2006, none of which has been based on a court order, as required by domestic law. Group 78 residents fear they may soon lose their homes, but have not given up hope that the authorities will respect the law and let them stay or provide fair and just compensation."
