 NA 
 Farac Ozcelik, a retired bank employee and father of 20 children, was detained at around 9pm on 28 February 1993 in Mazidagi, Mardin province. The reason for his detention is not known but there is much PKK guerrilla activity in the area and local people are often suspected of supporting Kurdish guerrillas. Under current emergency legislation he may be held for 30 days before appearing before a judge. AI fears that he is being tortured in incommunicado detention. "
