 DRC: Death penalty / Unfair trial 

 | Amnesty International 
 The trial of up to 135 people, including Anne-Marie Masumbuko Mwali and Rosette Kamwanya Beya, is due to resume on 19 March in the Congolese capital Kinshasa. All are accused of involvement in the assassination of former DRC president, Laurent-D_sir_ Kabila, on 16 January 2001. They will be tried by a military tribunal which does not meet basic international standards for fairness. Many of the defendants are likely to face the death penalty if found guilty.
