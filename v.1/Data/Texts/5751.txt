 Ecuador: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 The offices of the non-governmental organisation Acci¢n Ecol¢gica (Environmental Action) in the capital, Quito, were reportedly burgled on 22 May. The burglary appears to be a threat in response to the organisation's work on behalf of indigenous people in the Amazon opposed to the international companies drilling for oil in the region, and Amnesty International fears that the lives of the organisation's staff may be in danger.
