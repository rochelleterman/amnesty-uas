"Zimbabwe: Fear for safety 
 Zimbabwe: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Police and supporters of the ruling party, have been harassing and assaulting people living in Chimanimani, in the eastern province of Manicaland, particularly those whom they believe to be supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). They are also assaulting and intimidating human rights defenders and other observers in an apparent attempt to prevent news getting out. The local police and intelligence officers from the Central Intelligence Organization (CIO), have arbitrarily arrested and tortured people they perceive to be MDC supporters and have tried to prevent lawyers from seeing them in custody. Those responsible for these human rights abuses appear to enjoy complete impunity, and Amnesty International fears that the abuses will continue and will go unreported and unpunished.
