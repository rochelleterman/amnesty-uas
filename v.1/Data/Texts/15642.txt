 Russian Federation: Fear for Safety/Torture and Ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of Andrei Osenchugov and Aleksei Shishkin, who are both serving eight-year sentences in the Arzamas juvenile correction facility in the Nizhnii Novgorod region. Both teenagers allege that they were tortured whilst in pre-trial detention in early 2002 and a criminal case to investigate these allegations has recently been reopened. Law enforcement officials reportedly recently visited the teenagers in prison and threatened to use force if they did not sign documents requesting the closure of the case.
