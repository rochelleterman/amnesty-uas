 China: Further Information on Fear of torture or other ill-treatment/Prisoner of conscience, Ji Sizun (m) | Amnesty International

 On 7 January, legal activist Ji Sizun was sentenced by the Taijiang District People’s Court in Fuzhou, Fujian Province to three years’ imprisonment for “forging official documents and faking official seals” in 2006. Amnesty International fears that Ji Sizun’s sentence is politically motivated, and that he is a prisoner of conscience, held solely for exercising his rights to freedom and expression and assembly.
