 There is concern at the killing of Orelia Joseph in October. According to her daughters she was beaten and dragged from her home in Cite Soleil by armed men. Subsequently her head and legs were found in different places, while the rest of her body has not been found. Emmanuel Laurent broadcast an interview with the two daughters on Radio Tropic FM. On 8 November he was abducted by two armed men and reportedly ordered to lead them to the home of Venel Remarais, the Director of the Haitian Press Agency. Emmanuel Laurent managed to escape, but there is concern for both men's safety."
