"Kyrgyzstan: Death penalty 
 NA 
 Duyshenbek Askarovich Medetbekov, Ishenbek Askarovich Medetbekov: There is concern that these two brothers have been sentenced to death in Kyrgyzstan for murder. Their parents have claimed that they retracted their confessions in the first court session, claiming that they had been beaten in pre-trial detention. When the court resumed, the brothers again pleaded guilty, and their parents reported that their sons behaved oddly in court. An appeal against their sentences is now pending with the Supreme Court.
