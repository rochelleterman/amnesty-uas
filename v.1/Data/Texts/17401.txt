 Iran: Health concern / Torture / Possible Prisoner of Conscience/ Fear for safety: Ali Khodabakhshi (also known as Elyaz Yekanli) (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Ali Khodabakhshi (also known as Elyaz Yekanli), a prominent activist for the cultural, social and political rights of the Azeri Turkish minority in Iran, has been detained without charge since 8 June. He has been tortured in detention in order to extract a 'confession'. He may be detained on account of his peaceful activities on behalf of the Azeri Turkish minority, in which case Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience. The Ministry of Intelligence has allegedly been attempting to intimidate Ali Khodabakhshi's family and there are concerns for their safety.
