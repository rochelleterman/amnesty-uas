 Kenya: fear for safety: Staff of the Kenya Human Rights Commission, Staff of Kituo Cha Sheria legal aid centre | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 15 March 1995 a fire bomb was thrown into the offices of Kituo Cha Sheria, a legal aid centre in Nairobi. This is the sixth violent attack in recent weeks on the offices, which they share with the non-governmental Kenya Human Rights Commission. AI fears that there may be further attacks, leading to loss of life. The offices of the weekly ""Finance"" magazine suffered a similar attack on 1 February 1995. AI is concerned that the attacks are linked and are part of a pattern of intimidation of human rights activists and journalists who have publicly criticized the government."
