 Angola:  Unfair trial of Rafael Marques, a freelance      journalist | Amnesty International 
 Freelance journalist Rafael Marques is on trial for       ""defamation of the President"". Amnesty International is   concerned that his trial is being conducted unfairly,     before a judge who apparently has no legal training. He   is expected to be sentenced on 31 March 2000. If he is    imprisoned, Amnesty International will consider Rafael    Marques a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned for          exercising his right to freedom of expression.
