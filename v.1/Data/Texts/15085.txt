 The Lice Regimental Gendarmerie have now confirmed that the above men are in their custody. All three were due to appear before the Diyarbakir Prosecutor on 12 September, however, they did not, allegedly because the security situation in the area does not allow the gendarmerie to transfer the men to Diyarbakir. The Prosecutor and Regional Governor have both stated that they are powerless to expedite their appearance. There continue to be fears for the men's safety while in custody in Lice."
