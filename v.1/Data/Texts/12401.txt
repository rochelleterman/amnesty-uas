 Maldives: Further information on: Incommunicado detention/fear of torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 On 22 August the government announced that it had released 62 of the people arrested after mass pro-democracy demonstrations earlier this month. Subsequent reports give details of others released but it is not clear if these are in addition to these 62 people. Among the released was Muad Mohamed Zaki: he is not known to have been tortured, but he is not allowed to leave the country. The government has not named any of those released or still in custody, but Amnesty International has learned the names of a further eight detainees. All are at risk of torture.
