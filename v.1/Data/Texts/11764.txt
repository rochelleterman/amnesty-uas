 Yulius Petege, Yahia Pigome, Ben Kotouki and five others (names unknown) members of the Ekari tribe: Attempts by the Indonesian security forces to quell disturbances which began on 21 August 1997 in the Timika area of Irian Jaya, have resulted in two local tribes people being shot dead and 15 others being beaten severely.
