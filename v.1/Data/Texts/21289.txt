 Denmark: Forcible return / torture and other ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Danish authorities are preparing to forcibly return four men to Iraq, where they would be in danger of human rights abuses including torture or death. Denmark is a state party to a number of treaties that expressly prohibit them from returning anyone to a country where they would face this kind of danger. The men are held in Vestre FÃ¦ngsel prison, in the capital, Copenhagen."
