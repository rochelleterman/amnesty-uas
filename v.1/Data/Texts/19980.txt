 Cuba: Intimidation/Harassment: Ivonne Mallesa (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ivonne Mallesa was reportedly briefly detained by the Cuban Security forces on 10 March having been previously detained and released two days earlier. Amnesty International is concerned that were no legal grounds for either detention and believes she was held as a form of intimidation and harassment intended to prevent her from exercising her rights of freedom of expression, assembly and association. Amnesty International is also concerned that others may be similarly detained in the run up to the sixth anniversary of a crackdown on dissidents on 18 March."
