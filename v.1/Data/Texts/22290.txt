 Iran: Death Penalty: Bahman Salimian | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Juvenile offender Bahman Salimian is at imminent risk of being executed. He was sentenced to qesas (retribution) for the murder of his grandmother, committed in 1996 when he was 15 years old. His execution had been scheduled to take place on 28 August 2008. The execution was halted by the judicial authorities on 25 August to allow for further reconciliation attempts in order to negotiate a pardon from the only relative who still insists that the execution is to go ahead."
