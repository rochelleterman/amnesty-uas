 Concerns have increased for the safety of several groups of rebels from the Hmong ethnic community and their families. The groups, who are surrounded by Lao and possibly also Vietnamese army units, reportedly have little food and no access to medical care. Many are said to be suffering from serious health and nutrition problems, as well as exhaustion.
