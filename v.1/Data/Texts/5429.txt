 Cuba: Fear of ill-treatment/legal concern | Amnesty International 
 Political activist N‰stor Rodrçguez Lobaina, who began a six-year sentence on politically motivated charges in 2000, is facing a further trial which Amnesty International fears could be unfair and lead to his sentence being extended by four years. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression and association, and believes the new charges against him are fabricated.
