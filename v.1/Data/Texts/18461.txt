 UA 104/93 - Syria: Death Penalty: Proposed expansion of the scope of the death penalty | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 In April 1993 the Syrian National Assembly approved a new legal bill which included the death penalty for farmers, dealers and manufacturers of drugs. Amnesty International believes that this new law is contrary to developments in international standards and calls on President Hafez al- Assad not to sign the death penalty clause. "
