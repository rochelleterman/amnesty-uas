 Thousands of people living and working next to railway lines in Accra, Ghana face imminent forced eviction to make way for the redevelopment of the railway system. Known as the Railway Dwellers, the men, women and children who live and trade in kiosks and small structures built along the railway lines face homelessness and destitution if they are forcibly evicted from their homes following a renewed eviction threat on 21 January 2011.
