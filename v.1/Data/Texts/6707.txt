 On 17 December 1993 the first seven people named above were released. According to reports, Jean-Claude Thioffin, from the shanty town of Sans Raison, Gonaives, was arrested on 22 November in Port-au-Prince. He was taken to the prison in Gonaives where he was severely beaten. He has not yet been brought to trial. The same day Balaguer Metayer was arrested in Raboteau after being beaten and threatened. He was apparently brought before a court, but no ruling was made and he remains in detention. There are continued fears that the other seven people named above could be arrested and tortured or ill-treated."
