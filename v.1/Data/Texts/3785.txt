 Brazil: Fear for Safety, Roberto Monte, Pl√°cido Medeiros de Souza | Amnesty International 
 Human rights activist Roberto Monte and civil police chief Pl‡cido Medeiros de Souza have both received death threats. The threats are apparently linked to their investigation into the murder of a lawyer by a death squad, many of whose members are civil police officers. Their lives are in grave danger.
