 EXTRA 93/93 - Turkey: fear of torture / fear of ""disappearance"": Savme Durmaz, Sukru Durmaz | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is serious concern for the safety of Savme Durmaz and his 15-year-old son Sukru, who have been held in unacknowledged detention since 26 October 1993. They were detained by members of the gendarmerie force in the village of Alagoz, Mardin province. No reason for their detention was given. On 30 October six villagers and Savme Durmaz's youngest son, aged 10, all Assyrian Christians, were also detained when they went to the authorities to make inquiries. They were released two days later in very poor condition, allegedly having been tortured in detention."
