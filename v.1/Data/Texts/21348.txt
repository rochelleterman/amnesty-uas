 Switzerland: Fear of forcible return: Anatole Zali | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Eighteen-year-old Anatole Zali is at imminent risk of being forcibly returned to Cameroon by the Swiss authorities. Anatole Zali identifies himself as gay, and homosexuality is illegal in Cameroon. If returned he would be at risk of being imprisoned because of his sexual orientation, and Amnesty International would consider him to be a prisoner of conscience."
