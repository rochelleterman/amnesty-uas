 UA 201/93 - Sudan: fear of torture / incommunicado detention: Yousif Hussein, Abdel Karim Abdel Jaliel, Nadir Mahjoub Mohamed Salih | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The above named men, who are all members of the banned Sudan Communist Party, are reported to have been arrested on 11 June 1993, as part of a widespread clampdown on suspected political opponents of the Sudan government. All three have been arrested on previous occasions. Yousif Hussein, a geologist in his late 50s was detained without charge or trial for over two years following his arrest in January 1990. Abdel Karim Abdel Jaliel, a retired civil servant in his 60s, was reportedly held for several months in early 1992 and tortured. Nadir Mahjoub Mohamed Salih has been detained on four previous occasions. They have not been seen since their arrest and there are fears that they may be subjected to torture while in incommunicado detention. "
