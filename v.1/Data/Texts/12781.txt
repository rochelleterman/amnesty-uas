 Nepal: Fear of torture / Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Five Bhutanese people living in Beldangi 1 refugee camp, in the Jhapa district of eastern Nepal, are feared to be at risk of torture or ill-treatment following their arrest by Nepalese security forces on 2 and 3 June. The four men and one woman are all being held in incommunicado detention, and may be without access to their relatives, lawyers or medical attention. They appear to have been arrested on suspicion of involvement with the activities of the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN (Maoist)).
