 There have been reports of widespread arrests in towns and cities in northern Sudan in April and early May 1993. The majority of those whose names are known, are members of the Umma Party and Ansar sect, a traditional order in Sudanese Islam. Members of other political parties, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), have also been detained. It is believed that the 27 detainees named above have been arrested solely for engaging in their right to freedom of expression and association. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience. There is also concern that as suspected opponents of the government, they are at serious risk of being tortured. "
