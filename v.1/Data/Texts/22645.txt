 Saudi Arabia: Fear of Flogging/Prisoners of Conscience | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 In November 2007, Biochemistry lecturer Khalid al-Zahrani and a female academic were sentenced after an unfair trial to be flogged and imprisoned on charges that do not correspond to recognizable criminal offences. Their cases are now being reviewed by the Court of Cassation and, if the ruling is upheld, they would be at imminent risk of flogging and imprisonment. If they are detained, Amnesty International would consider them to be prisoners of conscience."
