 Honduras: Fear for safety / Death threats | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Bertha Oliva, coordinator of the Committee of Relatives of the Disappeared in Honduras (Comité de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos en Honduras, COFADEH) has been threatened with death. The threats may be linked to COFADEH’s work, in particular to its campaign for reparation for the relatives of Honduran victims of enforced disappearance, which has received national attention in recent months. Bertha Oliva’s safety, and those of her colleagues, could be at risk."
