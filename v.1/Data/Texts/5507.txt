 AI is concerned about further detentions and harassment of journalists, some of whom could face imprisonment as prisoners of conscience. Cuban state police recently strengthened their crackdown on independent journalists, issuing warnings that of they did not find work with a state entity, they could be imprisoned for four years on charges of ""dangerousness"". It is the first time that this provision, previously used against some human rights activists, has been used by the Cuban authorities against independent journalists."
