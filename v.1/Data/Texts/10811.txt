 Lodroe Gyatso, a Tibetan prisoner in Drapchi prison near Lhasa, may be facing trial and imminent execution. According to reliable sources he has been accused of shouting pro-independence slogans and attempting to circulate political literature within the prison on 4 March 1995. Originally sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment for murder in 1993, it is believed that he is now being interrogated by the Tibetan Administrative Region Public Security Office. He has reportedly been held in isolation cells since the incident and subjected to beatings. The exact charges against him are unknown, but sources fear he may be accused of offences carrying the death penalty."
