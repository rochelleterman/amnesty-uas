 L?onidas Hatungimana, Jamali Nsabimana, Ismail Hussein, Haruna Hamadi, Sa?di Nzanzurwimo (in absentia), Pierre Nkurunziza (in absentia) and Bosco Nyandwi: The seven men named above were sentenced to death on 12 February 1998 after being found guilty of allegedly participating in a series of mine explosions in Bujumbura, the capital, in early 1997, in which eleven people were killed.   All seven have denied the charges.  Amnesty International believes that their trial was unfair and is concerned at the limited appeals procedures open to the defendants and fears the prisoners may be executed.
