 Civilians have been targeted in Lebanon by the Israeli Defence Forces and in northern Israel by Hizbullah leaving hundreds dead. After weeks of fighting, bombs and rockets continue to fall indiscriminately on women,       children, ambulances, rescue workers and other innocent   victims of this escalating conflict. These deliberate     attacks violate international humanitarian law and        constitute war crimes.                                    "
