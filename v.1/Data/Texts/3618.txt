 Argentina: Fear for safety/death threats | Amnesty International 
 Maria Eva Arroyo, MarÁa Luz Piârola and Maria Cristina Saborido are among dozens of people seeking justice for themselves or relatives for human rights abuses committed while Argentina was under military rule (1976-1983), who have been threatened by people who appear to have links with the former military government. Some are under police protection, but this does not appear to be adequate. Amnesty International believes their lives are in grave danger.
