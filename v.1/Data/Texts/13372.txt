 AI fears that Azmi bin Tuki may be executed on 22 September 1995 following President Ong Teng Cheong's recent rejection of his appeal for clemency. Azmi bin Tuki, a heroin addict who comes from a poor ethnic Malay family, was arrested outside his home in December 1993 and discovered to be carrying heroin. He was convicted of drug-trafficking and sentenced to death despite the claim that the drugs were for his own and his girlfriend's consumption."
