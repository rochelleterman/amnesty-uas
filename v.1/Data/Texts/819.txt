 Ethiopia: Fear of imprisonment as POC / fear of ill-treatment: Svetlana Mamedova | Amnesty International 
 There is concern that Svetlana Mamedova, a naturalized Ethiopian citizen of Georgian origin, could face indefinite detention without charge or trial and ill-treatment, if she returns to the country. She was temporarily admitted to the UK on 12 June 1997 after deportation from Ethiopia where she had been detained and subject to ill-treatment for 14 months. The Ethiopian authorities have said that they will detain here again if she returns.
