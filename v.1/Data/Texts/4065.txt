 Juan Carlos Huenulao, Florencio Jaime Marileo, Juan Patricio Marileo and Patricia Roxana Troncoso, who began a hunger strike on 13 March, were examined in hospital and force-fed after this UA was issued, but then returned to Temuco prison. They abandoned their hunger strike on 14 May, but resumed it on 20 May, and are now demanding that the parliament pass a bill now being debated which would grant them some form of conditional release. Their health is in grave danger.
