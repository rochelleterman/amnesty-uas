 On 4 June the three Tzeltal indigenous women named above were reportedly tortured and then raped by members of the Mexican army. They were detained while returning to their community of Santa Rosita Sibaquil, Altamirano, Chiapas, and forced to confess to participating in the EZLN, Zapatista National Liberation Army. They were threatened with death if they reported the incident. On 29 June they were given a medical examination which reportedly found sequelae consistent with their allegations."
