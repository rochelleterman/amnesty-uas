 A group of East Timorese, believed to include four women and nine children, detained as they were attempting to leave East Timor to seek asylum in Australia, are feared to be at risk of torture and ill-treatment in detention. AI is concerned that the group appear to have been arbitrarily detained, apparently because they were attempting to leave East Timor and seek asylum."
