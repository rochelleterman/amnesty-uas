 Six leaders of a group managing the Baha’i community’s religious and administrative affairs in Iran were arrested at their homes by officers from the Ministry of Intelligence on 14 May 2008 and are now detained in Evin Prison in Tehran. A seventh person, acting secretary for the group, Mahvash Sabet (f), has been in detention since 5 March. They may all be prisoners of conscience, detained solely because of their religious beliefs or their peaceful activities on behalf of the Baha’i community."
