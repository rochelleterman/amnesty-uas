 Morocco: Death penalty: Stephane Ait Iddir, Radouane Hamadi, Hamal Marzoug | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The three men named above, a French/Algerian national, a French/Moroccan national and an Algerian national, were sentenced to death in Fes on 28 January 1995. They were tried, with 14 others, in connection with several armed attacks in November 1993 and summer 1994, in which tourists were killed. AI has expressed its concern about allegations that some of the defendants were tortured in garde a vue detention and that their trial may not have been fair. There is no right of appeal but defendants can seek a review by cassation in the Supreme Court. If the sentences are upheld, the last recourse is to present a plea for clemency to the King."
