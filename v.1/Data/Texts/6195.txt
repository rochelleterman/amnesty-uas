 Guatemala: Fear for safety/Death threat | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of witnesses of the Plan de S‡nchez massacre after a death threat note was found at the door of the home of one of the witnesses. This follows the intimidation of Edda Gaviola, director of the Centro para Acci—n Legal en Derechos Humanos (CALDH), the Centre for Human Rights Legal Action, whose home and office were broken into and important information about CALDH's work taken. Other CALDH staff members, as well as communities and organizations they work with may also be at risk.
