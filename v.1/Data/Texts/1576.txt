 Nigeria:  Amputation/legal/medical concern:Bello Garki    Zangebi | Amnesty International 
 Bello Garki    Zangebi has had his right hand amputated for stealing in    Zamfara State, in northern Nigeria.    This is the first     such punishment carried out since   Zamfara State           introduced a Sharia (Islamic law) Penal Code in January   2000. Amnesty International is    gravely concerned at this  development and fears that     others may be at imminent risk of the same punishment.
