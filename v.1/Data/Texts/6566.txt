 AI is concerned about reports of excessive use of force by members of the Guatemalan National Police who fired on students from the University of San Carlos in Guatemala City on 9 November 1994. One student died and some eight others were wounded. The students had been demonstrating about a rise in public transport fares and were pursued onto the university campus by police after some students had reportedly thrown rocks at the police. A forensic report into the death of 21-year-old law student Mario Lopez Sanchez concluded that he died as a result of multiple blows inflicted by members of the police and not as a result of the bullet wound. Some of the other wounded students are reported to be in a critical state. The government has promised to investigate the incident."
