 Up to 1,200 Eritrean asylum-seekers were forcibly returned to Eritrea between 12 and 19 June 2008. Reports from Eritrea indicate that most of the men who were returned and some of the single women have been detained in military training camps in the remote and dry area of Weâ€™a. The returned women with children and those who were pregnant are believed to have been released after some weeks in detention."
