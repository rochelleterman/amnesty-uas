Most recently four Turkish nationals were executed: Mehmet Nuri Koseoglu and Seyfettin Erkut on 11 August and Ahmet Mulayim and Fevzi dana on 14 August. It is reported that 20 of the 40 other Turkish nationals named above are on death row, with the remainder on trial on charges which carry the death penalty. There is also concern about the five Somalis named above, particularly 'Abd al-'Aziz Muhammad Isse who was found guilty of a crime which is said to have occurred before his arrival in Saudi Arabia. This information was apparently not available at his trial."
