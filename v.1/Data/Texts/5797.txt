 AI is concerned for the safety of Nidia Diaz, a prominent FMLN member and her bodyguard Elmer Cruz Zepeda after their vehicle was fired on near the university residence Los Lirios in the north of San Salvador. AI fears that this attack may be part of an intimidation campaign aimed at FMLN activists and supporters in the run-up to elections scheduled for 20 March 1994."
