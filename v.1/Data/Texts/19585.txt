 On 29 May 2003, the Zimbabwean opposition Movement for    Democratic Change called on Zimbabweans to participate in nationwide peaceful protest marches to protest against    the country's deteriorating economic, political and human rights situation. On Monday, 2 June, the police and army  responded with mass arbitrary arrests and attacks on      opposition supporters. Thus far, two people have          reportedly died from the attacks and over 400 people have been arrested across the country, at least five of which  are MDC Members of Parliament."
