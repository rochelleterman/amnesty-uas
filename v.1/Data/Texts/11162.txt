 India / Bhutan: Further information on imminent extradition: Rongthong Kunley Dorji | Amnesty International 
 Rongthong Kunley Dorji was released on bail on 12 June 1998, after being held in judicial custody in New Delhi for nearly 14 months.  Amnesty International is encouraged by this development, but remains concerned that he is still at risk of extradition to Bhutan where he could face serious human rights violations, such as torture and ill-treatment.
