 Colombia: Fear for Safety/Extrajudicial Executions - Leaders of SINTRAEMCALI and other trade unions in Valle del Cauca department | Amnesty International 
 The leader of a trade union campaigning against the       privatisation of Cali's public services has narrowly      escaped an assassination attempt. Another member of the   union died in the attack. The union's leaders have        received repeated death threats, and Amnesty              International believes that they and other union leaders  in the region are in grave danger.
