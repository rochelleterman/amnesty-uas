 Ahn Jae-ku, 61, a former professor of mathmatics, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 30 November 1994. He was reportedly convicted of forming an ""anti-state"" organization and spreading pro-North Korean ideology. During his trial he was forced to wear handcuffs 24 hours a day. These have apparently not been removed. AI considers him to be a prisoner of conscience who should be released immediately. This is the latest in a series of cases where AI fears that suspects may have had charges against them fabricated by the ANSP."
