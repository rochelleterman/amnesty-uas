 Gabon: Further information on fear of refoulement / ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 At least 123 Rwandese asylum-seekers in Gabon: On 9 August 1997, the Gabonese authorities reportedly forced 115 Rwandese asylum-seekers to board an aeroplane destined for Kigali (Rwanda). About 20 minutes after the aeroplane took off, the asylum-seekers reportedly threatened and assaulted the pilot and demanded that he fly them to another destination. The aeroplane eventually returned to Gabon, and on arrival the asylum-seekers were reportedly beaten by members of the security forces and led away to an unknown destination. Their current whereabouts are not known.
