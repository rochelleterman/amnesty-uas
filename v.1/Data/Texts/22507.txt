 Kuwait: Migrant worker faces execution: Jakatia Pawa (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The death sentence against a Filipina female domestic worker, Jakatia Pawa, was upheld by Kuwait’s Court of Cassation on 19 January 2010. The sentence will now be submitted to Kuwait’s head of state, the Amir, for ratification. This often takes between two weeks and a month, after which, if the sentence is ratified, Jakatia Pawa will be in imminent danger of execution."
