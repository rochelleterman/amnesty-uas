 Chad: Fear of ill-treatment / possible prisoner of conscience: Ngarlegy Yorongar le Moiban | Amnesty International 
 The above, a leader of the opposition party Action Front for the Republic-Federation, was arrested in Bebedjia, southern Chad, on 3 July 1996. Under Chadian law, he may be held without charge for 48 hours, renewable once for a further 48-hour period. This limit has now expired, and he has not been charged, although he has reportedly been accused of hiding firearms. AI is concerned that the real reason for his detention may be his non-violent political activities and fears that he may be at risk of ill-treatment in custody.
