 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Stop ethnic discrimination in employment [web action] | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s ethnic discrimination led to thousands of workers being unfairly dismissed from their jobs. A decade later, ethnic discrimination in employment is still widespread. The authorities and companies in Republika Srpska do not take sufficient steps to encourage minority refugees and internally displaced persons to come back to their previous workplaces. Without access to employment and financial security, those who fled their homes cannot hope to return and contribute to rebuilding multi-ethnic communities."
