 NA 
 The Libyan authorities are reportedly intending to deport seven detainees Zacharias Michael Belay (m), Misghina Seyoum (m), Mesfin Aman (m), Rezene Eyassu (m), Yonas Negussie (m), Michael Yemane, and Abel Tekle (m) to Eritrea in the coming days, apparently at the request of the Eritrean government. Should they be forcibly returned, the seven Eritrean nationals are at high risk of being arrested on arrival, detained incommunicado, and tortured. Those who had been previously detained for political reasons could face extrajudicial execution.
