 UA 91/94 - Colombia: fear for safety: Adelaida Sierra Avilez, and her four children | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Adelaida Sierra Avilez and her family, who have decided to return to the home they were forced to abandon in 1993. Following the arrest of her husband on 3 August 1993, Adelaida Sierra and her four children were then reportedly subjected to threats and harassment by members of the armed forces. They fled from their home and land in Puerto Inirida, Arauca department, but they are currently homeless and without means of support they have decided to return home. The authorities have taken no steps to protect the family, or investigate who is responsible for the threats."
