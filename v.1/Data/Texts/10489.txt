 Myanmar: Fear of torture/ arbitrary detention/ medical concern | Amnesty International 
 Three former student leaders (U Htay Kywe, Ko Ko Gyi and Paw U Tun [alias Min Ko Naing]) were detained by police Special Branch officers after dawn on 27 September. Amnesty International fears that they are at risk of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. They are reportedly held incommunicado without charge, in Special Branch offices and at the Ministry of Home Affairs, beyond the 24 hour period admissible under Myanmar law.
