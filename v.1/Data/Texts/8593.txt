 NA 
 A bill proposing to reinstate the death penalty in New York is likely to be debated in the New York legislature either during the week beginning 23 or 30 January 1995. The new Governor of New York State, Governor Pataki, has expressed adamant support for the death penalty and stated his intention to reinstate it in New York. AI is calling on him not to reintroduce capital punishment."
