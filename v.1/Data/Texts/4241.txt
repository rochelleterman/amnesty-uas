 Jesus Romero and another man, whose name is not known to AI, have not been seen since they and seven other men, all peasant farmers and fishermen, were abducted on 14 January 1995 from Patino, Aguachica, Cesar department by heavily armed men, believed to belong to the paramilitary group ""Los Masetos"". There is extreme concern for their safety. The seven other men were killed. The following day, brothers Melquicedet and Fanner Contreras Gomez were detained at a roadblock by men believed to be members of ""Los Masetos"". Their bodies were found on 17 January, bearing clear signs of torture. AI is concerned that a paramilitary group appears to be able to abduct and kill civilians with impunity in an area close to several military bases."
