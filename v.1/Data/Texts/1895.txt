 Rwanda: Arbitrary arrest / incommunicado detention / fear of torture: Alex Hakuziyaremye | Amnesty International 
 The above, a 25-year-old worker at Radio Rwanda, was arbitrarily arrested in Kigali on 11 July 1996. Two soldiers and one civilian took him from his home and led him to an unknown destination. Later, he was reportedly seen at the Directorate of Military Intelligence. He appeared to have been beaten all over and was described as being in a poor physical condition. Security officials have accused him of being a member of the former Rwandese government army, which was responsible for the massacre of many people in 1994. According to his relatives, however, this accusation is false.
