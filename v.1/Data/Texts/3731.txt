 Dr Waldo Albarracin, human rights defender and his family; and new name: Dr Juan del Granado, lawyer, human rights defender: During February 1997 Dr Waldo Albarracin has received anonymous telephone death threats against himself and his family, and they have been subjected to surveillance by unidentified individuals. Similar threats have reportedly been made against Dr Juan del Granado, lawyer and president of the Human Rights Commission of the Chamber of Deputies. It is believed the recent threats against him may be linked to his public condemnation of the abduction and torture of Waldo Albarracin. According to reports, he has received reassurances from members of the government regarding his safety, and an investigation has been initiated into the attack on Waldo Albarracin by the Commission of Constitution, Justice and Judicial Police of the Chamber of Deputies. There remains, however, concern for their safety.
