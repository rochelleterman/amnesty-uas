 NA 
 Luis Arturo Alvarez Concoa, a 32-year-old law student, reportedly ""disappeared"" on 26 March 1993. His body, bearing signs of torture, was found on 1 April. Herbert Alfonso Juarez Santizo, a student, was abducted by unidentified men on 27 March and seriously ill-treated. His abductors reportedly were seeking information about the student leaders of the University of San Carlos. He was released on the evening of 30 March and immediately hospitalized. AI is concerned about these events and fears that Herbert Juarez's abductors may have mistaken him for Victor Hugo Guidel, a student leader named in a death list issued on 27 March 1993 (see UA 96/93).
