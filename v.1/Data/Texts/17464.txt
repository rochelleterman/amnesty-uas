 Parisa was released on 5 December after receiving 99 lashes. The Supreme Court had changed her sentence of execution by stoning to flogging after reviewing the case. In November, the Supreme Court rejected the sentence of stoning against Shamameh Ghorbani (known as Malek). Her case will be sent back to a lower court for a retrial. A man, Abdollah F, is now known to be in prison under sentence of execution by stoning. There is no further information about the other women: Iran, Khayrieh, Kobra Najjar, Soghra Mola'i and Fatemeh.
