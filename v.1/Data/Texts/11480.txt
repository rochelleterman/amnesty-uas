 Indonesia / East Timor: intimidation / fear for safety: 29 abducted by ""Ninja"" gangs in Dili | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about gangs of hooded individuals, apparently acting with the support of the Indonesian military, have begun operating in Dili, East Timor. The gangs, referred to as ""Ninja"" gangs, are reported to have attacked houses, intimidated residents and to have abducted 29 people. Their primary target seems to be pro-independence activists and to intensify the atmosphere of fear for those opposed to Indonesian rule. The army have denied that these groups are linked to them but apparently have said that they do not intend to take action against the gangs at this stage."
