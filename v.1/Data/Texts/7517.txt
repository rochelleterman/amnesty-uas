"Mexico: Fear for safety 
 Mexico: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Pedro Eligio Cabanas, Daniel Sandoval, Erangelio Mendoza, Joel Garcia, members of a peasant organization: There are serious concerns for the safety of the people named above, members of the Broad Front for the Construction of the Movement National Liberation and the commission negotiating with the government of Guerrero State. On 5 August 1996, Pedro Eligio Cabanas was beaten before being bundled into a car by three members of the Federal Judicial Police, in Chilpancingo. The other men witnessed the incident. At present, the atmosphere in Guerrero is extremely tense: members of peasant organizations are being arested and threatened, apparently in connection with their activities on behalf of the local peasant population.
