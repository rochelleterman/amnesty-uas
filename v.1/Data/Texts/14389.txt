 Hatun Temuzalp (f), Ali Can Kaya, Arzu Gormez (f), Dilsan Acar (f), Muammer Kalkan, journalists; Tekin Yazar, Ali Ekber, Haydar (family name unknown), Hasan Acan: There is concern at reports that the above people, detained on 7 March 1997, have been tortured in custody, particularly Hasan Acan. Their detentions have now been acknowledged, but they remain incommunicado, presumably at the Anti-Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters. They all either work for or subscribe to the Proleter Halkin Birligi, Proletarian People's Union, a fortnightly socialist newspaper. Their arrests appear to be in connection with a possible demonstration to mark the second anniversary of the killing by police of at least 17 people in the Gaziosmanpasa district of Istanbul, during a week of unrest in March 1995.
