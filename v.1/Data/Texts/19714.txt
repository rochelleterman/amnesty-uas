 NA 
 On 28 November 2008, Osman Hummaida was released after being detained incommunicado for three days by the National Security and Intelligence Services (NISS) in Khartoum. On 26 November 2008, Abdel Monim Elgak was released after having been detained by the NISS that morning. Amnesty International believes that both Osman Hummaida and Abdel Monim Elgak were detained solely because of the peaceful exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and association. They were prisoners of conscience."
