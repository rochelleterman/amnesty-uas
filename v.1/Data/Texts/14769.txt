 At a hearing in Diyarbakir State Security Court on 1 May 1995, Sinan Tanrijulu, Firat Anli, Hanifi Isik and Servet Ayhan were released on the recommendation of the State Security Court Prosecutor. All incriminating statements given in court at the hearing were reportedly withdrawn on the grounds that they had been extracted under torture or threat of torture in police custody."
