 On the evening of 21 November 1995, Hakan Guler, Kadri Tursun and Koksal Gumus were abducted from a minibus by armed members of the PKK (Kurdish Workers' Party). Other passengers were released over the following days, but the three teachers remain in custody and there is grave concern that their lives are in danger."
