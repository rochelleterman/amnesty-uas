 UAE: Flogging: Sarah Balabagan (f), Filipina national | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 30 October, an appeal court in UAE sentenced Sarah Balabagan to one year's imprisonment and 100 lashes. It quashed the death sentence verdict passed by the court in the first instance on 15 September and ordered her to pay 150,000 dirhams blood money to the relatives of Almas Mohammed al-Baloushi, who was stabbed to death by the defendant. AI considers the punishment of flogging to be contrary to Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
