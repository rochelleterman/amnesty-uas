 NA 
 Juvencio Padron Duenas and three others are to be brought to trial later in December 1994 for the murder and robbery of two elderly people. It is reported that the prosecution intends to request the death penalty, at least in the case of Juvencio Padron Duenas. Juvencio Padron Duenas denies the charges against him. AI is concerned about allegations that the real motive for his arrest and imprisonment is political. AI is also concerned about reported beating of Juvencio Padron Duenas in detention and about his health. He was suffering from a brain haemorrhage before arrest and is said to have been hospitalized three times since, suffering from a stroke."
