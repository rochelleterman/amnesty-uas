 Palestinian Authority: Further information on prisoner of conscience / legal concern: Muhammad Dahman - human rights activist | Amnesty International 
 Muhammad Dahman was released on 27 August 1996. While Amnesty International welcomes his release, the organization remains seriously concerned that his detention appears to have been another example of attempts by the Palestinian Authority to put pressure on human rights activists who openly criticize it.
