 The Surabaya District Court in East Java is now reviewing the cases of the above. The three had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1989. The review follows a request from the family's lawyers, who filed a petition for a new hearing. The lawyers are arguing that there were irregularities in the original trial and that proper legal procedures were not followed. The three have already had their appeals for clemency rejected but the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court has said that this does not prevent them from continuing to seek a court review of their convictions."
