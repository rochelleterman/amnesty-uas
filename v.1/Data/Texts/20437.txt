 Peru: Death threats | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Journalist Julio CÃ©sar VÃ¡squez Calle is pursuing a complaint to the Piura region prosecutor's office against police officers and mining company security guards he claims tortured him while he was reporting on a protest in March 2005. On 5 February he received a phone call from a man who told him he would be killed unless he dropped his complaint. Amnesty International believes that he and the 28 members of peasant communities pursuing the same complaint are in grave danger."
