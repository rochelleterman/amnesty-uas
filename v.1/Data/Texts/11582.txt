"Indonesia: Death penalty: Second Lieutenant Sanurip 
 Indonesia: Death penalty: Second Lieutenant Sanurip | Amnesty International 
 There is concern that Second Lieutenant Sanurip was sentenced to death in a military tribunal on 23 April 1997, convicted of the murder of 11 soldiers and five civilians in Timika, Irian Jaya in April 1996. There is further concern that evidence of the suspect's state of mental health at the time of the killings was rejected by the tribunal. Amnesty International is urging the authorities to commute his sentence.
