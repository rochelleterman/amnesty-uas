 AI fears for the safety of John Joseph, the key witness in an ongoing murder trial. The murder victim was a Christian, charged with blasphemy, Manzoor Masih. AI is deeply concerned that his co-accused, Salamat Masih, aged 14, and Rehmat Masih, 40, have been sentenced to death for blasphemy. John Joseph has reportedly received death threats from Islamists in Lahore who are reported to be celebrating the death sentences of the two Christians."
