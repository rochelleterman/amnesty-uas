 The four men named above remain ""disappeared"". AI is particularly concerned for their safety in view of reports of a number of bodies being handed over by the armed forces for burial in Ocana, identified as ""guerrillas"" killed in combat. The bodies are at present being disinterred. Members of Luis Ascanio's family are apparently being held hostage by members of the army's Mobile Brigade no. 2: nobody is reportedly allowed to enter the home while soldiers await the return of his father, Abraham Antonio Ascanio.
