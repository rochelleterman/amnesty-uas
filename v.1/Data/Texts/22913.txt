 On 6 February 2008, the Moroccan Court of Cassation handed down its judgment in the case of the 10 men named in this action, members of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights (Association Marocaine des Droits Humains, AMDH). The Court upheld the one-year prison sentence against Abdelkbir Rabaoui, Brahim Ahansal and Mohamed Yousfi. However, the Court of Cassation dismissed on procedural grounds the three-year-prison sentence against prisoner of conscience Mohamed Boughrine, and the one-year-prison sentence against the six other members of the AMDH.
