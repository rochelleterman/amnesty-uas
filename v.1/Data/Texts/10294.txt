 Australia: Fear of forcible return / Fear for safety:     Libyan asylum-seekers with children. Names not given to   protect their identity | Amnesty International 
 After a failed attempt on 1 December 1999 to deport a     Libyan asylum-seeker and his family to Libya, Amnesty     International is very concerned that they are at risk of  another attempt by the Australian authorities to deport   them imminently. Amnesty International believes that if   returned, the asylum-seeker would be at serious risk of   torture.
