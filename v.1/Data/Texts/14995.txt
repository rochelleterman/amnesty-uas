 There are grave fears of the safety of Ihsan Yazici, who was detained in Diyarbakir on 19 July 195 and whose detention remains unacknowledged. Ishan Yazici, a livestock trader and owner of a tea garden, has been detained several times previously and tortured. One of his sons is said to have been a PKK member; he was killed. Ihsan Yazici's family has been constantly harassed by the police and has reportedly received death threats."
