 According to the Iran-based Advar News website, on 9 August 2008 Mehdi Khoda’i and Salman Sima were released. They have not, as yet, been charged. The other 10 students, named in this action, remain in detention and are facing various vaguely worded charges, such as ""acting against national security""and “disturbing public opinion”. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience, held on account of their conscientiously held beliefs, and is calling for them to be released immediately and unconditionally. "
