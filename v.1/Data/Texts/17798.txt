 Israel: Fear for Safety | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that the implementation of the Israeli government decision of 19 September 2007 that ""Additional sanctions will be placed  on the Hamas regime in order to restrict the passage of   various goods to the Gaza Strip and reduce the supply of  fuel and electricity. Restrictions will also be placed on the movement of people to and from the Gaza Strip"" would  cause a further deterioration of the already dire         humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip and adversely    affect the 1.5 million Palestinians who live there.
