 On 19 May 1994 the offices of the women's organization MSM were reportedly broken into, and the following day Alexander Rodas Abarca, aged 18, a reserve member of the National Civilian Police, was killed as he was guarding the MSM offices. The identity of the attackers is not clear, but there are fears that the events may be linked to a campaign of intimidation aimed at political activists, which has spread to popular groups."
