"Togo: Impunity 
 Togo: Impunity | Amnesty International 
 The Togolese government has responded with furious        denunciations, the arrest of  human rights defenders and  the torture of an Amnesty International member to AI's    latest report on Togo, published in May 1999. The report  documents hundreds of killings, systematic use of         torture, and arbitrary detention. The Togolese            authorities have made no attempt to open investigations   into human rights violations, or begin proceedings to     bring those responsible to justice. The government is     attempting to sue Amnesty International and has launched  a  high-profile publicity campaign against the            organization.
