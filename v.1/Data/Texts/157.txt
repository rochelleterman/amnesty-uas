 AI representatives visiting Burundi have found that at least 12 people, including Jean Minani and Tharcisse Nzimpora, are undergoing torture sessions during interrogation at the Brigade speciale de recherche (BSR) in Bujumbura. The 12 are suspected of involvement in the assassination of the former mayor of Bujumbura, Lieutenant Colonel Lucien Sakubu. AI's representatives expressed concern about these abuses to several government officials but it is unclear whether any action has been taken to stop the torture."
