 Canada: Further Information on Conscientious Objector Dean Walcott (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Dean Walcott has been allowed to stay in Canada until the countryâ€™s Federal Court decides whether or not to review his case. It is not yet known when this will be decided. He had been due to be deported to the USA on 30 January. If deported to the USA, he risks being court-martialled and imprisoned for between one and five years and would therefore be a prisoner of conscience."
