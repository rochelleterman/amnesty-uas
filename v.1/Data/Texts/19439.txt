 NA 
 On 28 January 2008, after an unfair trial, journalist Faustin Bambou was sentenced to six monthsâ€™ imprisonment and a symbolic fine of one CFA Franc (a Central African currency used in six countries; one CFA Franc is equivalent to 0.2 US cents) by the High Court (Tribunal de grande instance). Amnesty International believes that Faustin Bambou is prisoner of conscience, imprisoned for exercising his right to freedom of speech in pursuit of his professional activities."
