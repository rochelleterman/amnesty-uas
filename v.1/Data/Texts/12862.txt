 Pakistan: Fear for safety / unacknowledged detention | Amnesty International 
 Zamir Hasan Ansari, aged 60, Feroza Khanom (f), Riffat Anjum (f), Anjum Kamal: AI is gravely concerned for the safety of Zamir Hasan Ansari, his wife Feroza Khanom and their two grown-up children, who reportedly went missing from their home in the capital Islamabad on 1 May 1996. There is evidence to suggest that the family may be in the custody of the Inter Services Intelligence, although their detention has not been officially acknowledged. Relatives have received information to indicate that they may have been detained because of an alleged suspected link between Zamir Hasan Ansari and the Indian authorities, as he was stationed in New Delhi whilst working for the Pakistan Foreign Service between 1985 and 1990. There are fears that the family may be subjected to ill-treatment whilst in detention.
