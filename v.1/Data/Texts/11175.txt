 India: Further information on Death Penalty/Imminent execution, Dhananjoy Chatterjee (m) | Amnesty International 
 The execution of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, scheduled for Friday 25 June, was stayed on 24 June for the President to consider a mercy petition submitted by Chatterjee's family. The President's decision is expected soon: he often commutes death sentences, but as there is widespread popular support for the death penalty in this case, international pressure may be vital.
