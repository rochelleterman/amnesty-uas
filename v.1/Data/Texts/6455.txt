 NA 
 According to reports 11 journalists have appeared on a list of people for whom arrest warrants have been issued. Those named include writers for the Diario Siglo XXI, the Diario Prensa Libre, Diario El Grafico, and Diario La Hora. One is described as the General Secretary of the Media Union, another as a correspondent for Reuter's news agency. These warrants were issued in the wake of Jorge Serrano's announcement on 25 May 1993 that he had replaced the rule of law with rule by personal decree. "
