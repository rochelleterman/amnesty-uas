 UA 236/93 - Peru: ""disappearance"": Justiniano Najarro Rua | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Justiniano Najarro Rua, a baker, reportedly ""disappeared"" on 6 July 1993 in San Juan de Miraflores district, Lima, following his detention together with his 14-year-old nephew, by two armed men who reportedly identified themselves as policeman. His nephew was subsequently released on 7 July, and according to his testimony, he had been constantly ill-treated and asked about Justiniano Najarro's alleged ""subversive"" activities. However the authorities have repeatedly denied any knowledge of his detention, and Justiniano Najarro remains ""disappeared"". On 15 July a habeas corpus writ was presented before a judge, but it is not known whether the judge has acceded to the petition. "
