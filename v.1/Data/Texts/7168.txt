"Jamaica: Forcible Return of Asylum Seekers, Six Haitian nationals 
 Jamaica: Forcible Return of Asylum Seekers, Six Haitian nationals | Amnesty International 
 Six Haitian nationals, understood to be seeking political asylum, are at risk of being forcibly returned to Haiti. They were among 131 Haitians who landed in Jamaica on 18 November; the rest have already been returned to Haiti without any proper examination of their asylum claims. Amnesty international has longstanding concerns about human rights violations in Haiti, and fears their lives may be in danger if they are returned.
