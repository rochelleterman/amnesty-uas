 There is serious concern for the safety of the inhabitants of the shanty town of Raboteau, Gonaives, Artibonite department, following a recent spate of attacks and illegal arrests by the military. According to reports on 19 December 1993 a mixed patrol of soldiers and attaches (armed auxiliaries) twice went to the town and subjected the citizens, including young children and pregnant women, to harassment and beatings. The military were apparently looking for Amio Metayer. Before leaving, the patrol reportedly fired their guns into the courtyard. Two people died as a result of the events: Evalliere Bornelus apparently drowned while attempting to flee the firing, and Louisiana Jean, an elderly woman, died of shock."
