 Israel/OT:Further information on  Fear for Safety:  Palestinians in Nablus and Jenin. | Amnesty International 
 The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) withdrew from Jenin on 25 April 2002. From 4 to 15 April, the IDF effectively blocked ambulances and humanitarian aid from reaching residents of Jenin refugee camp, including the sick and wounded. During this period the IDF used bulldozers to reduce a large area of the camp, containing more than 100 two- and three-storey houses, to rubble. An unknown number of people were buried under the rubble, while the IDF continued to block access. It appears there was no absolute military necessity for much of this demolition.
