 AI is gravely concerned for the safety of some 50 young pro-democracy activists arrested on 20 February 1995 in Yangon (Rangoon). They were arrested during the funeral of U Nu, Myanmar's first prime minister. According to reports, Maung Maung Ol and Moe Myat Thu were badly beaten at the time of their arrest. AI has no further information about their whereabouts or the conditions of their detention."
