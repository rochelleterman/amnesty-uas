"Mexico: Fear for safety: Doctor Maria Luisa Mussot (f), social rights activist 
 NA 
 Doctor Maria Luisa Mussot, a representative of the Coordinating Committee of Women in Defence of Social Security, and member of the Front for the Defence of Social Security, received an anonymous threatening phone call on 25 January 1997. This is the latest and most direct incident in a campaign of intimidation against her, and there is grave concern for her safety. She has worked with unions and other civic organizations to campaign in defence of workers' social rights which are being adversely affected by recent legislation. Other colleagues involved in the campaign have also suffered similar phone calls.
