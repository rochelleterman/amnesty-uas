 USA: Death penalty / legal concern: Victor Kennedy | Amnesty International 
 Victor Kennedy is scheduled to die in Alabama's electric  chair on 6 August 1999. He was sentenced to death in 1982 for murder. It is alleged that police violated his rights at the time of his arrest and there is evidence to        suggest that his part in the murder was significantly     less than that of his co-defendant, Darrell Grayson.
