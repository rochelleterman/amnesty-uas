 Palestinian Authority: Health Concern/Legal Concern,      Jawid al-Ghussein (m), aged 71, Palestinian businessman. | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the health and safety of Jawid al-Ghussein, who was abducted from his hospital bed in Cairo, Egypt on 3 January 2002. He was apparently taken by members of the Palestinian security service to Gaza in the Palestinian Authority, where he had previously been held for several months incommunicado. Amnesty International believes he is being held for political reasons, possibly because of his past criticisms of policies of leading members of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO).
