 NA 
 Following a military court hearing on 21 January 2010, Turkish conscientious objector Enver Aydemir will have to appear before a higher court. He remains unlawfully detained in a military prison. His lawyer told Amnesty International that the hearing for ‘persistent insubordination’ concluded that his offence was too serious for that court to consider and referred the case to a higher military court. The date of that hearing is not yet known. "
