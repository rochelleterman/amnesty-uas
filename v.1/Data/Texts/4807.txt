 Colombia: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 There is concern for the safety of prisoners at the Nacional Modelo, the Vistahermosa, the Picalena, El Bosque and Quibdo prisons, following a spate of recent riots which have left a number of prisoners dead after security forces allegedly resorted to excessive force to quell the disturbances. Tension in the prisons has increased as prisoners have embarked on hunger-strikes in protest at their conditions of detention.
