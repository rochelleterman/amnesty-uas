 Besim Sokol Rama, Avni Smajl Nura, Idriz Halit Asllani, ethnic Albanians: The three men named above were convicted by the district court of Pristina with 12 other ethnic Albanians, who were tried in absentia. There is concern that the defendants did not receive a fair trial and that Besim Rama and Avni Nura were tortured or otherwise ill-treated by police after their arrest in September 1996 when they were illegally detained incommunicado for two weeks.
