 Nepal: Fear for safety/ possible ""disappearance"". Maina   Sunuwar (f), aged 15, school student

 | Amnesty International 
 15-year-old Maina Sunuwar was reportedly arrested on 17 February by security forces personnel in plain clothes. Her whereabouts are unknown and Amnesty International is concerned that she may have ""disappeared"". They were looking for one of Maina Sunuwar's relatives, who had been present when two women from a nearby village were shot dead by security forces personnel on 13 February in an alleged extrajudicial execution. They could not find the relative, so they took Maina Sunuwar instead.
