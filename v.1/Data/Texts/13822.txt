 Sami Meta, Kristaq Mosko, Timoshenko Pekmezi and Tare Isufi: Sami Meta and Timoshenko Pekmezi were released on 29 December 1996 when President Berisha issued a decree releasing or reducing the sentences of 102 prisoners. Kristaq Mosko was released on 5 November 1996. The current situation of Tare Isufi is unknown, but it appears that as he was detained under house arrest rather than in prison before his trial, he will have to serve the full year's sentence and will be due for release by the end of February 1997.
