 Mexico: Fear for safety: Yasser Vilchez Grant Domingo (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Nicaraguan national Yasser Vilchez Grant Domingo, who was travelling illegally through Central America, injured his foot in southern Mexico. On account of being a migrant, doctors refused to treat him, and the infection spread to his foot and leg. On 12 March 2009 his leg was amputated at the thigh. He filed a complaint against the doctors, but has been threatened and told not to pursue the complaint. Amnesty International believes that he is at risk of reprisals and fears that he may be deported to Nicaragua before his case is fully investigated."
