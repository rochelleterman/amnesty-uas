 Haiti: Eviction threat for makeshift camp in Haiti | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Over 300 people who have been living in a makeshift camp in the capital of Haiti since their homes were destroyed in the earthquake in January 2010 have been threatened with forced eviction. Amnesty International is concerned that if evicted they may not receive alternative adequate accommodation and will be forced to live on the streets."
