 Salaheddine Zikikout was sentenced on 21 October 1993 to 18 months' imprisonment for membership of an unauthorized organization and the unauthorized collection of funds. The sentence was upheld on appeal on 18 January 1994. There is concern at allegations that he was ill-treated in illegally prolonged incommunicado detention, and that both the Court of First Instance and the Appeal Court failed to order an investigation into these allegations. Amnesty International believes that he should be retried or released."
