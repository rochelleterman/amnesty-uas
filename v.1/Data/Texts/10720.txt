 Xiao Yunliang is reportedly suffering deteriorating health in custody and has begun spitting blood. His family and fellow activists have petitioned the authorities on his behalf but so far this has had no effect. Amnesty International is gravely concerned for his safety and wellbeing. Wang Dawei, Gu Baoshu, Wang Zhaoming and Pang Qingxiang, all originally detained in March 2002 and since released on bail, continue to suffer harassment and constant surveillance.
