 Iran: Fear of imminent execution: Mohammad Assadi | Amnesty International 
 There are fears that Mohammad Assadi, a 68-year-old lawyer, may be at risk of imminent execution. He was reportedly arrested in September 1993 and held in secret detention in a military prison for a year. In March 1997 it was reported that he had been sentenced to death and to confiscation of his property. He is said to be currently held in Evin Prison in Tehran. The exact charges against him are unknown, but they appear to be political, and there is also concern that his trial may have been unfair.
