 Mexico: Further information on Fear for safety / Possible ill-treatment, Brigadier General Jos√© Francisco Gallardo Rodr√≠guez | Amnesty International 
 The Bordo de Xochiara prison authorities have installed a public telephone near General Gallardo's cell, so he has ready contact with the outside world. They have also moved high-risk prisoners to a different wing of the prison. According to the General's family, this is a response to intense national and international pressure from Amnesty International members and others.
