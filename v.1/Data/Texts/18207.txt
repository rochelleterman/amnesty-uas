 Faisal Ahmed Suleiman Abu Teilakh and Sa'id al-Barrawi Mohammed al-Najjar were executed by firing squad in Gaza on 6 June, just 24 hours after they were sentenced to death for rape and murder by the State Security Court, following an unfair trial. They were not given the opportunity to appeal to a higher court against their death sentence, in violation of international standards for fair trial.
