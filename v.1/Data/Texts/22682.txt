 Saudi Arabia: Imminent execution, ‘Abdullah Fandi al-Shammari (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International has received information that ‘Abdullah Fandi al-Shammari is due to be executed within the next 20 days. According to an appeal issued by his family, his execution was scheduled for around 15 November but, following an intervention by Crown Prince Sultan bin ‘Abdul Aziz, he was granted a 30-day reprieve to enable his family a last chance to seek pardon from the family of the person he was convicted of killing."
