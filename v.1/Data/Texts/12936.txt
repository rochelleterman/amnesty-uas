 AI continues to call for the immediate and unconditional relase of Zafar Yab Ahmad, a journalist who has been charged with sedition and ""promoting hatred between groups"". He is alleged to have undermined ""Pakistani interests abroad"". He has now been transferred to judicial custody where the conditions are better and he is receiving medical care. Fatima and Karamit Ali were released after a few hours detention. Mohammad Salim is being held for questioning about documents relating to the activities of the director of the Bonded Labour Liberation Front."
