 Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: Fear for safety / fear of ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 On 9 July 1997 violent clashes occurred between police and ethnic Albanian demonstrators in the town of Gostivar, which left two dead and more than 100 injured. At least five police officers were also injured, some by gunfire, and a large number of demonstrators were detained. Some have reportedly been charged with firearms offences. The clashes arose after a law was passed restricting the use of flags of minorities to special occasions. Amnesty International is calling for a prompt and thorough inquiry into the reported deaths and injuries.
