 Russian Federation: ""Disappearance""/fear of torture and   extrajudicial execution | Amnesty International 
 Two women are believed to have been abducted by Russian federal forces in the Chechen Republic. Eliza Gaitamirova, a mother of four, was on her way home from being questioned by police when she was apparently stopped by men in camouflage who took her away. Milana Kodzoeva was questioned about allegations that she wanted to become a suicide bomber and had plans to go to a training camp for Chechen fighters. Though she denied these allegations, men in camouflage came to her house and forced her to go with them.
