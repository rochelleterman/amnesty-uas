 Haiti: Arbitrary arrest/prisoner of conscience: GÃ©rard    Jean-Juste (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Catholic priest G‰rard Jean-Juste, aged 59, was taken into custody at a police station ""for his own protection"" on 21 July, after he was assaulted, but while he was at the police station he was accused of murder. He was abroad at the time of the murder of which he has been accused, but he is a prominent opponent of the government. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience, detained solely because he has peacefully exercised his right to freedom of expression. He risks spending a long time in custody awaiting trial on apparently trumped-up charges.
