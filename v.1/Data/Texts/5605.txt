 Cuba: Further information on medical concern / prisoner of conscience: Roberto Lopez Montanes | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is extremely concerned for the health of the above, a 43-year-old member of an unofficial group belonging to Concilio Cubano. Prisoner of conscience Roberto Lopez Montanes, who is serving a 15-month sentence for ""disrespect"" and ""falsifying documents"", suffers from a serious heart condition. He was given a pass from prison to seek medical attention but was later detained with his wife. His condition worsened and Roberto Lopez Montanes was finally transfered to an intensive care unit.
