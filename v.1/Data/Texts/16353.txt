 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Fear for safety: non-Serbs in Bosnian Serb-controlled areas | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 In recent days between 100-200 thousand Croatian Serb refugees have fled into northwest Bosnia-Herzegovina in advance of the Croatian Army advance into the Krajina. Large numbers of Croatian Serb soldiers are reported to be retreating into northwest Bosnia also. AI is investigating allegations of human rights abuses by the Croatian army during the offensive. However, AI is also seriously concerned about the possibility of violations against Croats, Muslims and Roma in the Banja Luka area by the newly arrived Croatian Serb soldiers, either as acts of retribution or to obtain accomodation. AI fears that non-Serbs will be intimidated and forcibly expelled from this area."
