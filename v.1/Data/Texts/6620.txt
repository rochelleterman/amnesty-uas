 UA 309/93 - Guatemala: fear for safety: Maurillo Chiquin | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Maurillo Chiquin, a member of the Consejo Nacional de Desplazados de Guatemala, the National Council of the Displaced of Guatemala (CONDEG). On 1 September in Coban, Alta Verapaz, he was watched and followed by two armed men in civilian clothes, but wearing military boots, often a sign of membership in the Civil Defence Patrols. There is a history of abuse and intimidation directed against members of CONDEG by members of the army and paramilitary forces. "
