 EXTRA 57/93 - Turkey: ""disappearance"" / fear of torture: Masallah Subasi, Burhan Subasi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Masallah Subasi and Burhan Subasi are believed to be held in secret detention at the Anti-Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters. There are fears they may be being interrogated under torture and are at risk of ""disappearance"". On 7 June 1993 the two men and their elder brother Metin Subasi were taken into custody from their home in the Bagcilar district of Istanbul and taken to the Anti-Terror Branch of the Istanbul Police Headquarters. The following day Metin Subasi who claims he was beaten and subjected to falaka (beating on the soles of the feet) was released. On 15 June lawyers checked the record of prisoners held by the Anti-Terror branch, but the names of the brothers had not been entered. "
