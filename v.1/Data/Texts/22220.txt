 NA 
 Blogger Hossein Derakhshan, 35, a dual Canadian-Iranian national, has been unfairly tried and sentenced on 28 September 2010 to 19 and a half yearsâ€™ imprisonment on vaguely worded charges relating to national security. He was detained without charge for about19 months prior to trial and denied regular access to his family and lawyer. Amnesty International believes he is likely held solely for the peaceful expression of his views, and if so should be immediately and unconditionally released. "
