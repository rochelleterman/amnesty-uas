 USA (Federal): Death penalty / Legal concern- David Ronald Chandler | Amnesty International 
 Ronald Chandler, the first person to be sentenced to death after the federal death penalty was reintroduced in the USA in 1988, has petitioned President Clinton to commute his death sentence before he leaves office on 20 January 2001. There are serious doubts about Chandler's guilt, and about the adequacy of his legal representation at his 1991 trial.
