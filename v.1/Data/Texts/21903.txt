 Egypt: Forcible return / Fear of torture or other ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Egyptian authorities intend to forcibly return student Maskhud Abdullaev, a Russian national from Chechnya, on 18 June at noon on a flight from Cairo International Airport to Moscow, Russia. If he is returned to Russia, he will be at risk of torture or other-ill-treatment. Egypt is a state party to the UN Convention against Torture, which expressly prohibits the return of anyone to a country where they would be at risk of torture. Maskhud Abdullaev would be at heightened risk because his father, Supyan Abdullaev, is the leader of a Chechen armed group. The five others are also to be returned on the same day and would also be at risk."
