 Egypt: Detained protestor in Egypt ill-treated: George Ramzi Nakhla | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 6 February 2012 George Ramzi Nakhla was arrested after taking part in a protest in Cairo. He has reportedly been ill-treated while in detention and has not received adequate medical treatment. Amnesty International fears George Ramzi Nakhla may be a prisoner of conscience arrested solely for exercising his right to peaceful assembly."
