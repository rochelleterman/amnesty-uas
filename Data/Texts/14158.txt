 Ismail Bahceci has not been seen since late December 1994 and there are fears that he is being tortured in unacknowledged police custody. He had reportedly been in hiding as there was an arrest warrant in force for him. He is accused of being a leading member of Devrimci Genc, the youth wing of the banned Devrimci Sol (Revolutionary Left)."
