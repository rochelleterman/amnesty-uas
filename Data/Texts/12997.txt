 Pakistan: Possible prisoner of conscience/detention without charge/fear of forcible transfer, Dr Amir Aziz and three unnamed medical staff. | Amnesty International 
 Dr Amir Aziz is being held without charge at an unknown   location. There are fears that he may be forcibly         transferred to US custody, where he may be at risk of     human rights abuses, without regard to Pakistan's         extradition requirements and in violation of              international legal standards. The whereabouts of three   other men who were subsequently arrested are also         unknown.
