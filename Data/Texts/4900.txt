 Colombia:  Further information on fear for safety: Population of CurumanÃ­ municipality, Cesar Department and members of the non-governmental human rights organization Minga

 | Amnesty International 
 The human rights organization Minga has launched a campaigning initiative on behalf of the community of Curumanç, Cesar Department, where at least 22 peasant farmers were killed by paramilitary gunmen on 4 and 5 December 2005, and the leader of an army-backed paramilitary group has responded by labelling the human rights group a ""guerrilla organization"". This amounts to a death threat, as others labelled this way have often been killed by the army or paramilitaries.
