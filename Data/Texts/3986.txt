 There have been reports of a massacre of an estimated 40 Yanomami Indians from the Haximu village, allegedly by gold prospectors in northern Roraima state. News of the massacre reached a catholic mission in the Xidea region on 17 August 1993 after terrified members of a neighbouring village arrived to take refuge. Members of the government's indian agency FUNAI, Fundacao Nacional do Indio, investigating the massacre have subsequently interviewed survivors and visited the site on 19 August. "
