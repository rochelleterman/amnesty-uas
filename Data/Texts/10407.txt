 NA 
 AI is gravely concerned for the safety of Myanmar refugees in Thailand near the border with Myanmar, who in the last two weeks have been at risk of attack by forces allied with the Myanmar military authorities. In an attack on 23 February 1995, Don Kio Poon, a driver, and two women refugees, Me Paw and Peh, were killed. Me Paw was five months pregnant. Eleven others were seriously injured, including three children."
