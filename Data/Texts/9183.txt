 USA (Alabama): Death penalty / Legal concern - Robert Lee Tarver, African American | Amnesty International 
 Robert Tarver is scheduled to be executed in Alabama's    electric chair on 14 April 2000. Appeals for Robert       Tarver to be granted a new trial on the grounds of racial discrimination during jury selection have been            unsuccessful because his trial lawyer had failed to raise it early enough, thereby causing Tarver to lose it as an  appeal issue.
