 Joseph Spaziano is now scheduled to be executed in Florida on 21 September 1995. An indefinite stay of execution was granted by Governor Chiles in June 1995 but this has been lifted. AI has been unable to discover the reason for the lifting of the stay. AI opposes the death penalty in all cases and is appealing for this sentence to be commuted."
