 Chad: Further information on fear of ill-treatment / fear of extradition / fear of ""disappearance"" and extrajudicial execution | Amnesty International 
 Souleymane Garfa, Ahmada? Sabre and Sileck Sagga were     deported to Chad from Sudan on or around 3 August 1999.   Amnesty International is concerned that the men were      deported despite clear evidence that they could face      serious human rights violations, including                ""disappearance"" or extrajudicial execution, if they were  returned to Chad.
