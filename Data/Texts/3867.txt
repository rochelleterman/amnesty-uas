 Brazil: Fear for safety - Eduardo Bernardes da Silva | Amnesty International 
 A neofascist group, who threatened several times to kill  Amnesty International staff member Eduardo Bernardes da   Silva, have traced him to the location where he was moved for his safety. Amnesty International is concerned that   the group appear to have informants within the police     force, and believes that Eduardo and Amnesty              International members in Brazil are in danger.
