 Ukraine: Ukraine obliged to halt extradition: Ahmed Chataev : Further information | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 14 January 2010 the European Court of Human Rights called upon the Ukrainian authorities not to extradite an ethnic Chechen man, Ahmed Chataev, to Russia until further notice. Ahmed Chataev has been granted refugee status in Austria and was visiting the Ukraine with a valid visa when he was arrested on January 3. Amnesty International believes that if he is returned to Russia, he could face an unfair trial and would be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. "
