 Behcet Ekinci, who is in unacknowledged police custody in Diyarbakir, was allegedly tortured during the first three days following his arrest on 21 September 1993 by officers from the Anti-Terror Branch of Diyarbakir Police Headquarters. There is also concern about seven people who were detained after visiting his house, and who are now also in incommunicado detention. On 23 September, Behcet Ekinci's family submitted a petition requesting confirmation of his detention, but the prosecutor responded that he had no current list of detainees from the police. "
