 NA 
 On 20 September, US servicewoman Kimberly Rivera was arrested and detained by US military authorities after losing her deportation case in Canada and returning to the USA. She faces a court martial for desertion and a prison sentence. As she is being detained solely because of her conscientious objection to participating in the armed conflict in Iraq, she is a prisoner of conscience. "
