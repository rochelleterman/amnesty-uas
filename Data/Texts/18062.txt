 Up to 200 people, mostly believed to be supporters of General Michel 'Aoun, were reportedly arrested after Lebanon's Independence Day celebrations on 22 November 1992. The arrests are believed to have been in connection with the printing and distribution of leaflets calling for Lebanon to become ""truly independent"". At least 19 are reported still to be held without legal warrants. Ten of them reportedly began a hunger strike on 30 November; Jose 'Afif, a bank manager, has been hospitalized after reportedly having a heart attack on 5 December. Two others, Antoine Samieh and Emile al-Hachem, were hospitalized with injuries sustained through torture. The cases of 11 of the detainees have reportedly been referred to a military investigating judge. "
