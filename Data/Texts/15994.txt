 AI is concerned that a group of 19 prisoners standing trial in Georgia on terrorism charges face ill-treatment or lack of appropriate medical care in detention. One of them, Zaza Tsiklauri, was reportedly transferred back to prison from hospital as a punishment for meeting with a human rights activist. Viktor Domukhovshy was reportedly beaten in his cell by police officers and two others, Zurab Bardzimashvili and Mamuka Daniela, reportedly have health problems which are not receiving adequate attention."
