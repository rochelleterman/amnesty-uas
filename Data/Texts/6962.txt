 EXTRA 52/94 - Haiti: fear for safety / extrajudicial execution: Jean-Marie Vincent, and other members of the Montfortain religious order | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Father Jean-Marie Vincent was shot dead on 28 August 1994 by unidentified men in front of the residence of the Montfortain religious order, near the Saint-Louis Roi-de-France church in the Turgeau area of Port-au-Prince. Prior to his death he was the director of the Haitian Foundation for Economic and Social Development (FONADES). Members of the religious sector believe he may have been targeted by security forces because of his close connections with President Aristide. There is now concern for the safety of any other priests belonging to the Montfortain order, and who may be supporters of President Aristide."
