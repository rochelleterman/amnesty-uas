 USA: Ohio governor stays two executions | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Governor of Ohio has reprieved two male prisoners who were facing execution in the next month, to give prison authorities more time to establish a “back-up” lethal injection protocol following a recent failed execution. A third man is still scheduled for execution on 8 December. The governor has said he will issue further reprieves if he deems it necessary."
