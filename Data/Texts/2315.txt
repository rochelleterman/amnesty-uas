 The twelve youths named above are in custody at Boksburg Prison on the East Rand, under quasi-state of emergency regulations currently in force in Thokoza and other East Rand townships. All thirteen, whose ages range between 13 and 18 years, were arrested on 8 and 9 August 1993 in Thokosa by officers of the South African Defence Force (SADF). Eye-witnesses and medical evidence indicate that all thirteen have been subjected to assaults, torture and threats. Ntsanana Sekgonyane, released on 17 August, was still recovering from a car accident, when he fell unconscious after being kicked all over his body. There is particular concern for Pheelo Nkaki, who suffers from physical handicap and very severe learning difficulties. "
