 Haiti: Fear for safety/Death threats | Amnesty International 
 Evel Fanfan, a lawyer and president of a human rights organization, has received death threats. This follows the murder of a fellow human rights activist, Bruner Esterne, who witnessed a massacre allegedly perpetrated by an armed group with the help of police officers. Amnesty International is gravely concerned for his safety and that of his family. Members of his organization (including Colin Reginal, the Deputy Executive Secretary) and residents of the local community may also be in serious danger.
