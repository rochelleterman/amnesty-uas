 Francisca Nzang Ebasi (f) and Norberto Esono: Francisca Nzang Ebasi and her 10-day-old baby were arrested apparently for no other reason than for being the wife and son of Alberto Ngomo Mfumu, a member of the Progress Party and the first democratically-elected mayor of Nkimi. It appears that she is being held to force her husband to return from Malabo where he is attempting to meet the central authorities to discuss matters related to the Nkimi council. In a separate incident Norberto Esono, a councillor in Niefang council and member of the PP, was arrested on 19 May 1996 and badly beaten by police.
