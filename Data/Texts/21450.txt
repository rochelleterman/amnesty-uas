 Forcible eviction of families from “temporary” accommodation in the Chechen capital Grozny in Russia has continued. The Prosecutor’s Office has found no violations of the right to housing. Since mid-January, dozens of families living in at least seven family hostels (obshchezhitie) in Grozny have received eviction notices from the local authorities, who have not offered alternative accommodation. According to the Russian human rights NGO Memorial, between 14 and 21 January 2011, 62 families were evicted from family hostels, and forcible evictions have continued since. "
