 | Amnesty International 
 On 4 December, Ahmed RodrÁguez Albacia, a journalist for the Cuban-based independent press agency, Youth without Censorship, was reportedly arrested at his house in Havana by State Security personnel and National Police officers. He is being held at the police station located at 100 Street and Aldab¢ Street in Havana. Amnesty International is concerned that he may be a prisoner of conscience, arrested solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression, association and assembly in the course of his journalistic work. According to reports, days before his arrest, he, his family and several dissidents were subjected to so-called ""acts of repudiation"".
