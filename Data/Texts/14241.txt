 Plainclothes police officers from the Anti-Terror branch of Diyarbakir Police Headquarters raided the office of the weekly Denge Azadi (Voice of Freedom), a bilingual Kurdish-owned newspaper, on 8 January 1995. They searched the premises, confiscating documents and computer disks and detaining the staff. All but the two people named above were later released. When a lawyer tried to gain access to Ahmet Killi and Cagatay Isik, police denied that they were being held or that they were registered as detainees. There is extreme concern for their safety."
