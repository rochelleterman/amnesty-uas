 Russian Federation: Further information on Fear of forcible return/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has learned that 13 ethnic Uzbek men have been released from detention and are now at liberty in Russia. Amnesty International is concerned     that     they could still face forcible return to         Uzbekistan in    the future. There is good reason to      believe that if they  were returned, the men would be at  risk of serious human  rights violations, including       torture, unfair trials       leading to long prison terms or even the death penalty.
