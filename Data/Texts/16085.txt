 Tajikstan: Further information on Imminent execution/unfair trial/torture/ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 The executions of brothers, Dovud and Sherali Nazriev have reportedly been put on hold, following an intervention by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in January 2002. The brothers have appealed to President Imomali Rakhmonov for clemency, and their appeals will be decided by the Clemency Commission. It is not known when the decision will be taken. Continued action by Amnesty International members may save their lives.
