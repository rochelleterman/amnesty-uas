 Hunger-striking administrative detainees Samer al-Barq and Hassan Safadi are in grave danger as their health deteriorates. They are protesting against their detention without charge or trial and repeated incidents in which they say they were ill-treated by Israel Prison Service (IPS) guards as punishment for their protest."
