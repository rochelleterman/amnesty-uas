 Mahmut Dogan, the local reporter in Elazig for the Kurdish-owned newspaper Ozgur Gundem, was detained in the town of Bingol on 2 June 1993. He is said to have gone to Bingol to report on a major military operation launched by the security forces in the region against guerrillas of the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK). It is feared that Mahmut Dogan may be subjected to torture while being held incommunicado at the Anti-Terror Branch of Bingol Police Headquarters "
