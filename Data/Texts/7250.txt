 On 9 January 1997 an attack took place on the offices of the Coordinacion de Organismos No Gubernamentales por la Paz (CONPAZ) in San Cristobal del las Casas, Chiapas, when unidentified individuals broke in and tried to set the offices on fire. This is the latest in a series of threats and attacks against CONPAZ since November 1996. Concern for the safety of CONPAZ members is heightened by the government's failure to bring the perpetrators to justice.
