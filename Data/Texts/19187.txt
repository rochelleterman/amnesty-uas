 The above, a prominent human rights activist and parliamentarian, was brought to trial on 3 July  1996. As the trial date was announced at short notice, the defence lawyers asked that the trial be postponed, and a new date was set for 17 July. He is charged with disclosure of confidential information in the judicial inquiry concerning POC  Mohamed Mouadda, President of the Social Democratic Movement. AI now believes that Khemais Chammari is being held as a prisoner of conscience because of his peaceful political and human rights activities.
