 Khaled al-‘Omair, Mohammed al-‘Otaibi, Kamil ‘Abbas al-Ahmad, Zuhair al-Janbi and at least 21 others, have been detained after taking part in or attempting to hold protests against Israel’s current military action in Gaza. They are held incommunicado, and Amnesty International believes they are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment."
