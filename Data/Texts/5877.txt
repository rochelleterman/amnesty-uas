 UA 403/94 - El Salvador: possible extrajudicial execution / fear for safety: David Faustino Ramirez (killed); Carlos Cortez Hernandez, Pablo Parada Andino (injured) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about the kiling of opposition activist David Faustino Ramirez in an attack on 11 November 1994 which left two others wounded. David Faustino Merino Ramirez, a member of the FPL and of the FMLN (now a legal political party) was gunned down as he was having lunch with Carlos Cortes Hernandes, member of Teoluca town council and Pablo Parado Andino, FPL coordinator in San Vicente. The killing has the characteristics of the politically-motivated ""death squad"" type killings of the recent past. David Merino and Carlos Cortes Hernandez were involved in the land transfer program to ex-combatants. David Merino and Pablo Parado Andino had survived previous attacks by unknown individuals."
