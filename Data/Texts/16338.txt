 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Forcible expulsions / fear of hostage-taking: Croats in the Bosnian-Serb controlled area of northwest Bosnia | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There have been new reports of forcible expulsions of non-Serbs from northwest Bosnia. On 4 May 1995 two groups of Croatian Roman Catholic nuns were taken by soldiers from their convents in the area of the towns of Bosanska Gradiska and Nova Topola and made to cross into Croatia. Although they were not physically ill-treated during the expulsion, they had to pass through a minefield. In another incident, on the night of 2 and 3 May, a grenade was reportedly thrown into the courtyard of the Catholic Bishop's residence in Banja Luka. Although there were no casualties reported, there are fears that these reports may indicate a wider patter of intimidation against Croats in northwest Bosnia."
