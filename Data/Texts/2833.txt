 The six people named above were arrested in Khartoum at the beginning of June 1994. Their current whereabouts are unknown and there is concern for their safety. They are reported to be members of the Sudan Communist Party and trade unionists. It is believed they may be prisoners of conscience detained for their peaceful political and trade union activities. Ali al-Mahi al-Sakhi, Siddiq Yusuf and Suliman al-Khidir have all been detained on previous occasions."
