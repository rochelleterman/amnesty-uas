 Human rights lawyer Pablo Gabriel Salinas has received an anonymous threat apparently related to his work. His life and the lives of his family may be in danger. In December 2005, he received threatening telephone calls, and the    office he shared with human rights lawyers Marça Ang‰lica Escayola and Alfredo Guevara Escayola, was daubed with    graffiti. Amnesty International is not aware of any       further threats against the other two lawyers.
