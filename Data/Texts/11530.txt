 AI is concerned about the arbitrary arrest of those listed above on 16 March 1995. They were arrested, apparently without warrants, after a social gathering to celebrate the end of Ramadan. Ahmad Taufik, Liston P Siregar and Sri Bintang Pamungkas were released after several hours in custody. Ahmad Taufik was later rearrested on 17 March. Danang, Eko Maryadi Fitri, and one other are also reported still to be detained. The arrests appear to be in connection with an independent magazine published by the Alliance of Independent Journalists, considered illegal by the government. AI fears that they have been detained solely for their peaceful activities."
