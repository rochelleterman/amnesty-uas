 On 10 November 1992 members of the security forces reportedly detained shepherds Mehmet Akan, aged 70, and Mehmet Akkum from the village of Kursunlu in Diyarbakir province. The body of Mehmet Akan was found in the fields on 11 November; Mehmet Akkum has ""disappeared"". The security forces detained another 11 men in Kursunlu village on 12 November. All efforts by their families to establish their whereabouts have failed. AI fears that they are being interrogated under torture, presumably about suspected links with PKK guerrillas. "
