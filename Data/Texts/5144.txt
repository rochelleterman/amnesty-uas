 UA 360/92 - Colombia: unacknowledged detention / fear of ""disappearance"": Bertha del Pilar Hernandez Aldana | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Bertha del Pilar Hernandez Aldana, a teacher aged 21, has not been seen since her reported detention by members of the armed forces close to the town of San Vicente de Chucuri, Santander department, on 12 November 1992. She was reportedly detained at the rural school where she works by a patrol of the army's Brigada Movil, which has been involved in counter-insurgency operations in the area. The Brigada Movil has, however, not acknowledged her detention. There is serious concern for her safety. "
