 The Maldives: Further information on denial of medical treatment / deteriorating health conditions: Ismail Saadiq | Amnesty International 
 There is grave concern at the Maldivian authorities continued stance on preventing Ismail Saadiq from seeking access to adequate and necessary medical facilities despite continuing reports of his deteriorating health. Ismail Saadiq has not been tried and the decision on whether or not he should remain in detention is reportedly solely with the Maldivian President.
