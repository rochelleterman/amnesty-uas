 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Arbitrary detention / fear of torture or other ill-treatment / forcible expulsion: Bosnian Muslim refugees from Srebrenica | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There are grave fears for the safety of Bosnian Muslim refugees fleeing the UN ""safe area"" of Srebrenica in Eastern Bosnia, following reports of the arbitrary detention of men of military age and of the ill-treatment of civilian refugees by Bosnian Serb armed forces. AI is further concerned that international observers have not been granted access to those in detention, who, according to Bosnian Serb officials, are to be ""screened"" for alleged war crimes. AI is disturbed by reports that women, children, the elderly and wounded, who have been transported out of Potocari, are being forced to walk up to 10km to cross to Bosnian Government-held territory. There have also been reports that, despite promises of safe conduct, young women in these groups have been abducted by members of the Bosnian Serb forces."
