 Sri Lanka: Deliberate and arbitrary killings / fear of further killings: Eleven bus passengers, killed; Civilian population in areas of conflict | Amnesty International 
 According to independent sources, members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) deliberately killed 11 bus passangers, including four women and a two-year-old child, on 12 September at Arantalawa, Amparai district. It is believed that among those killed are two Muslim men; all others are members of the Sinhalese community. AI is concerned that civilians appear to have been arbitrarily killed solely on the basis of their ethnicity.
