 Mexico: Further Information on Fear for safety/Use of excessive force and new concern: fear of unfair trial | Amnesty International 
 Pedro Lagos Gonzalez, a supporter of the alternative local administration set up in opposition to the mayor (Presidente Municipal) in Tlalnepantla, State of Morelos, was detained on 18 February and is reportedly now in prison. Amnesty International fears that because of the current political situation in the municipality he may not receive a fair trial. Benjamin Medina was reportedly detained on 27 January, and charged with the killing of Gregorio S‡nchez. Carlos Cede–o Cort_s was reportedly detained the same day, and charged with obstructing the murder investigation. Both men are supporters of the Consejo Popular Aut—nomo, and this has raised concerns about the nature of the evidence against both men.
