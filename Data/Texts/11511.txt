 Hundreds of East Timorese have been detained by the Indonesian security forces in recent weeks. Many of those arrested before the anniversary of the November 1991 Santa Cruz massacre, suspected of opposition to Indonesian rule, were released after interrogation but the fourteen named above and possibly many others are reportedly still in custody. Their precise whereabouts are unknown, heightening concern that they may be subjected to torture or ill-treatment. "
