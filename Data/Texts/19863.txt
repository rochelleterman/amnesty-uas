 NA 
 Documentary filmmaker Elena Varela López is being held in Rancagua Prison, central Chile. She is currently filming a documentary which she has been researching for the last four years, on the conflict between lumber companies and Chile's Mapuche Indigenous people, over the use of land. Amnesty International believes that the authorities have arrested her in an attempt to halt investigations into this conflict and in an attempt to intimidate her and the Mapuche Indigenous people."
