This is the latest in a series of threats and intimidation against him since April. Enes Kuban Kural believes the threats are in connection with his campaigning activities protesting against the 2014 Winter Olympics being held in Sochi, Southwest Russia. He has asked the authorities to provide him with protection, which has not yet been granted."
