"United Arab Emirates: Further information on death penalty: John Aquino 
 NA 
 It now appears that the death sentence against John Aquino, a 33-year-old Filipino worker, was not quashed by the Federal Supreme Court as was reported previously. Recent reports suggest that on 1 February 1997 the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi decided to uphold his death sentence unless he receives clemency from the victim's family by 8 March 1997. There is concern that he remains at risk of execution.
