 Russian Federation: Sokolov's detention extended further | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A court has rejected Alexei Sokolovâ€™s appeal and extended his pre-trial detention until 25 December 2009. He appears to have been detained solely for his peaceful human rights activities, and is unlikely to receive a fair trial. He is still at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. "
