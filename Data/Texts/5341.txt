 EXTRA 74/94 - Colombia: fear for safety: Tirso Velez | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI fears that further attempts may be made on the life of Tirso Velez, Union Patriotica (UP) mayor of Tibu, before he leaves office on 31 December 1994. There have been several foiled attacks against him, most recently on 13 September 1994. A ""death squad"", apparently linked to the armed forces, has allegedly been set up to kill him. Tirso Velez's bodyguards may also be in danger, given that the orders for the attack planned for 13 September were reportedly to carry out a multiple killing if necessary."
