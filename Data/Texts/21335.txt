 Spain: Fear of forcible return/Fear of torture or other ill-treatment / Fear of unfair trial | Amnesty International

 Ali Aarrass and Mohamed el Bay are at imminent risk of being extradited to Morocco, where they would be at risk of incommunicado detention, torture and other ill-treatment as well as an unfair trial.  The Spanish national criminal court approved the extraditions in late 2008 and they must now receive final confirmation from the Council of Ministers. If the extraditions go ahead Spain will be violating its obligations under international human rights law, including the UN Convention against Torture."
