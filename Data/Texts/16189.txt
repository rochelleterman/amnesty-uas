 Turkmenistan: Further information on prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Suleiman Udaev was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment on 7 August. Amnesty International regards him as a prisoner of conscience, jailed solely to punish him for refusing to serve in the army on religious grounds. The situation of the three other Jehovah's Witnesses (Bayram Ashirgeldiev, Nuryagdy Gairov and Aleksandr Zuev) is believed to be unchanged.
