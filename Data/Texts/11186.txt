 UA 113/93 - India: fear of extrajudicial execution: Umrao Singh | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of Umrao Singh and fears that he may be tortured or killed in police custody. He was arrested in Delhi on 1 April 1993 and detained without charge in Lodhi Road Police Station Interrogation Centre until he was handed over to the Punjab police on 7 April. On 14 April police reported that he had escaped. Umrao Singh's family and lawyer fear that he may still be in police custody and may be tortured and killed following a persistent pattern of extrajudicial executions and deaths in custody in Punjab, which are often attributed to an ""encounter"" between militants and police, or to an ""escape"" during such an ""encounter"".
