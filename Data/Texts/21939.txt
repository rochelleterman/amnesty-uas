 Iran: Death penalty/ stoning | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Gilan Mohammadi (f), and Gholamali Eskandari (m) are believed to have been detained since 2003, and were sentenced to death by stoning probably in 2005 or 2006. Their sentences are believed to have been confirmed by the Supreme Court sometime in 2008. The Head of the Judiciary declared a moratorium on executions by stoning in 2002, but at least five people are known to have been stoned to death since then, two of them on 26 December 2008. "
