 Ahmad Qatamesh, detained on 1 September 1992, continues to be held in interrogation in Ramallah Prison where he allegedly has been ill-treated. His health is said to be deteriorating. His lawyer reports that he is only being allowed to sleep for short periods and is apparently made to sit for most of the day in a low chair, hooded and with his hands shackled behind his back. His wife, Suha Barghouthi, was released on 25 September and in her affidavit of 26 September has described the conditions in which she was kept. Since her release she has reportedly been summoned to appear before the Civil Administration in Ramallah. She is currently on hunger strike. "
