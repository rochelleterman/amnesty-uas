 There is concern for the safety of Paulino Velandia Baron, a municipal councillor, Fanny Correa and her son William Correa, following a violent assault on the Correa's house in El Cocuy, Boyaca department, by members of the armed forces on 5 February. Paulino Velandia had visited their house after being threatened by soldiers who had intercepted him as he left a town council meeting. Fanny Correa's husband, Edgar Suescan Zambrano and their small daughter Sandra Correa were both killed in the attack. Fanny Correa and her son were seriously wounded and are now recovering in hospital. Sources state that their relatives have been unable to see them, as they are under permanent police guard."
