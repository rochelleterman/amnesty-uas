 There is concern for the physical and mental well-being of Zola Mabala and Brian Madasi who were allegedly severely tortured and beaten by police during the first two months of their detention. They are in custody at Pollsmoor Prison near Cape Town, and have been held in prolonged detention awaiting trial including periods of isolation. They were arrested on 4 January in Elliot in the Eastern Cape, and were held incommunicado under section 29 of the Internal Security Act until 3 February."
