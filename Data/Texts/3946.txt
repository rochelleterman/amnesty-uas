 Brazil: Fear for safety: 250 members of the Guarani-Kaiowa indigenous community in Jarara | Amnesty International 
 AI fears for the safety of some 250 members of the Guarani-Kaiowa indigenous community following a court ruling to evicit them from land they have occupied in Jarara, Juti municipality, Mato Grosso do Sul. Military police have frequently resorted to excessive force in carrying out eviction orders and concern for the well-being of the Indians is compounded by their renewal of a threat to commit collective suicide rather than be evicted.
