 UA 385/94 - South Africa: death threats / extrajudicial executions: Beauty Mkhize, Yunus Cajee | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Beauty Mkhize and Yunus Cajee have received anonymous telephoned death threats. They have both been threatened before, but fears for their lives have been greatly heightened by the murders this year of other prominent community leaders in Driefontein - Lazarus Yende, Hendrietta Nkabinde and Mbotisa Dlamini. Police have failed to effectively investigate this pattern of killings. Beauty Mkhize is Chairperson of the South African Rural Women's Movement and a field worker for the Transvaal Rural Action Committee. Yunus Cajee is a member of the African National Congress (ANC)."
