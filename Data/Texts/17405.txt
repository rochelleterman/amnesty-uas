 Iran: Fear for safety/ Unfair trial/ Possible prisoner of conscience: Reza Abbasi (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Human rights defender Reza Abbasi, a member of the Azeri Turkish minority in Iran, has been detained in the city of Zenjan in northwestern Iran since 27 June, and is at risk of torture or ill-treatment. His trial, which does not appear to comply with international fair trial standards, is in progress. He may be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely on account of the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression, including his human rights work.
