 AI is seriously concerned for the safety of the above who are believed to be in incommunicado police custody in Diyarbakir. They have not been seen since leaving the People's Democracy Party building on the Ofis district of Diyarbakir on 5 November 1995. Nevin Yakut works for the Turkish Human Rights Association (HRA) but is not a member of the HRA. The others are members of HADEP's local youth committee."
