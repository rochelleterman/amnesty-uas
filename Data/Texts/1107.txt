 NA 
 Professor Wangari Maathai, environmentalist and opposition activist, has gone into hiding in fear for her life following a public accusation by President Moi on 20 February 1993 that she was distributing ""inflammatory leaflets"" in the Uasin Gishu district of western Kenya where there have been clashes between members of the Kalenjin and Kikuyu ethnic groups. Her colleague, John Makanga, was arrested and beaten on 25 February 1993 (see UA 54/93, AFR 32/06/93). AI is concerned for her safety. "
