 Syrian brothers Ghassan Mustafa Ma’lul and Ahmad Mustafa Ma’lul were arrested at a checkpoint at al-Rabikh, near Saraqeb, Idlib province, in northern Syria on 20 November 2011 and have been held in incommunicado detention since. On 13 April 2012, they were shown on Syrian TV “confessing” to murder. Amnesty International believes they are at serious risk of torture or other ill-treatment. "
