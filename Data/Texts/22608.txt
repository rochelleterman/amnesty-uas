 Saudi Arabia: Prisoners of conscience/Torture | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Dr Abdullah al-Hamid and his brother, ‘Issa al-Hamid, have been sentenced to four and six months’ imprisonment respectively for ""incitement to protest"". They had supported a peaceful demonstration by women outside the prison in Buraida in which the women called for their relatives, who are political detainees, to be charged and given fair trials, or else released. The two brothers are due to start their prison sentences on 8 March 2008; if they are imprisoned, Amnesty International would consider them prisoners of conscience."
