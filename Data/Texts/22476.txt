 Israel / Occupied Palestinian Territories: Medical Concern | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Six children in the Occupied Palestinian Territories suffering from serious heart conditions need urgent surgery that cannot be provided in Gaza, which lacks both the necessary medical facilities and specialists. The children were due to be operated on by a team of British heart specialists at Makassad Hospital in East Jerusalem during the week beginning 4 October 2008. They were not able to leave the Gaza Strip because the Israeli authorities refused permissions to their mothers/grandmothers to leave Gaza to accompany them. "
