 Indonesia: Fear of torture and ill-treatment: Suwigno | Amnesty International 
 Suwigno was arrested in Jakarta on 3 September 1996 after he had visited the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute. He is believed to have been arrested for his alleged connections with the unofficial political group PRD. Amnesty fears he is being held in military custody, and it is assumed that he does not have access to lawyers, placing him at serious risk of ill-treatment or torture, as is frequent in political cases in Indonesia.
