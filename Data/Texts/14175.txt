 Ramazan Yazici, aged 36, Hakki Kaya, aged 30, truck driver; and new names: Atilla Korkmaz, supermarket owner, Mahmut Onerari, aged 22, minibus driver, Tevfik Kusun (all Kurds): There is no further information on the whereabouts of Ramazan Yazici or Hakki Kaya since they ""disappeared"" after being taken into police custody in Diyarbakir in November 1996. Fears for their safety have been heightened by the discovery of the bodies of three young Kurds taken into custody in Diyarbakir during the first half of December 1996. The bodies of Atilla Korkmaz, Mahmut Onerari were found by a main road near Adiyaman on 23 December with signs that they had been beaten and shot in the head. The body of Tevfik Kusun was found near Adiyaman on 7 January 1997.
