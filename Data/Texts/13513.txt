 Sri Lanka: Further information on Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Dr Kasippillai Manoharan and members of his family have reportedly been further threatened and intimidated by the security forces. Dr Manoharan's son Ragihar was among five Tamil students allegedly extrajudicially executed by security forces personnel in January, and a Magistrate's Court hearing into the killing of the five students is due to take place on 29 June. Dr Manoharan is the only witness to come forward to testify for the prosecution. Amnesty International is concerned that the threats may be an attempt to force him and any other potential witnesses to withdraw from the case.
