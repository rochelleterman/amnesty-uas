 NA 
 Romeo Legaspi, a journalist and publisher, was abducted on 11 January 1993 by armed men believed to be linked to the Philippines National Police. He has not been seen since. Before his abduction he had reportedly been threatened because of a newspaper article he had written critical of the police. The police have denied having him in custody and his whereabouts remain unknown. His family have filed a writ of habeas corpus on which the Supreme Court has yet to decide. Since filing the habeas corpus petition his family have reportedly received anonymous death threats, believed to come from the police. They have also been visited by the officers of the Police Criminal Investigation Service. "
