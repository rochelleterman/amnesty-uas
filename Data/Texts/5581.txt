 The above-named human rights activists were arrested on 10 December 1992. Elizardo Sanchez, former Professor of Philosophy at Havana University and president of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation, was reportedly severely beaten when security agents broke into his house, destroying much of its contents. The day after his arrest, an ""act of repudiation"" was carried out at his family home by a large crowd who chanted pro-government slogans and threw stones at the house. He has been detained several times previously for his human rights activities. Rodolfo Gonzalez, a member of the Cuban Committee for Human Rights, was reportedly arrested after a search of his home. AI believes both to be prisoners of conscience. "
