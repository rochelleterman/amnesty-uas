 Israel/Occupied Territories.: Fear of torture/legal concern/possible prisoner 
of conscience, Daoud al-Dir'awi | Amnesty International 
 Lawyer Daoud al-Dir'awi was arrested on 10 September, as he returned from a family holiday. We have received reports that he is being interrogated by the Israeli General Security Services (GSS). He is held without access to his lawyer or family, which puts him at greater risk of torture or ill-treatment. Amnesty International believes he may be a prisoner of conscience, arrested in connection with his human rights work.
