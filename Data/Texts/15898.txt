 The Ukrainian authorities, who appear to be under increasing pressure from the Russian authorities, are making serious preparations to forcibly return Lema Susarov, aged 25,  to Russia, where he would be in danger of         torture. The head of the Ukrainian Security    Service told  an Amnesty International delegate on 29     September 2007    that ""if we openly refuse Russia's      request, they will     [come into Ukraine and] remove the people regardless.""
