 UA 13/94 - United Arab Emirates: death penalty: Mashal Badr al-Hamati | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A death sentence passed by a court in Abu Dhabi in 1991 upon Mashal Badr al-Hamati, a young Yemeni national convicted of murder, has been upheld by the Supreme Court. The case has now been passed to His Highness al-Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan for final confirmation. There is concern at the fact that Mashal Badr al-Hamati was just 17 years old at the time of the offence, and that there are aspects of the case which have not been clarified, such as the disputed circumstances of the killing itself."
