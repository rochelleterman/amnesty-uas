 Three Kurdish political activists, who remain incommunicado, failed to appear in court for the third session of their trial on 19 October 2010. The men were not brought to the hearing and an explanation was not given by the court, heightening concerns over their safety. They remain at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. "
