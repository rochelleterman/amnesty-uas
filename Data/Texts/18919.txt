 Algeria: Fear for safety / ""Disappearance"" / legal concern: Karim Khelili | Amnesty International 
 On 4 February 1998, Karim Khelili, who has a mental handicap, was arrested by security forces and is currently detained incommunicado. AI is concerned that he may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment and that he may be denied the specialist medical care he requires. AI believes he has been taken as a consequence of his father's involvement in human rights work.
