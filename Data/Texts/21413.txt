 NA 
 Yulia Privedennaia, a civil society activist and leading member of a group whose stated aim is to promote a happier society, has been sent to a psychiatric hospital by a Moscow court. Independent psychiatrists say that there was no basis for hospitalizing her. Amnesty International believes that her forced hospitalization amounts to arbitrary detention."
