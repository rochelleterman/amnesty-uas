 Sierra Leone: Denial of right to seek asylum: Liberian asylum-seekers aboard the Victory Reefer | Amnesty International 
 Dozens of refugees from Liberia aboard the Victory Reefer have been refused entry to neighbouring Sierra Leone to seek asylum. About 41 asylum-seekers are reported to have been effectively forced to return to Monrovia, which they had fled almost two weeks earlier to escape escalating violence in Liberia's civil war. AI is concerned that the Sierra Leone authorities have broken their commitments under international refugee law.
