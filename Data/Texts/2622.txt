 Scores of people, including those named above, have been arrested by the military or national security forces in Khartoum, Nyala, Geneina and other towns in the Darfur region over the past month. They are all being held without charge at security forces detention centres or at Kober prison in the capital Khartoum. Amnesty International fears that they may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment as they are being held in incommunicado detention.
