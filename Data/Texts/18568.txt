 Muhammad Ghazi Hubayibaged around 50, doctor was arrested on 16 April at Damascus airport, when he returned from exile, and has been held incommunicado since then. His arrest is apparently connected to his former affiliation to the unauthorized Muslim Brotherhood Organization, and Amnesty International fears that he may be tortured.
