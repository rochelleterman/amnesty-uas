 The transitional government, which assumed the running of the country at the beginning of April 1993, announced that a commision of inquiry would be sent to southern Chad to investigate the widespread reports of army atrocities there since 21 January 1993. The inquiry took place from 19 to 28 April 1993, and made a number of recommendations, including the removal of military officers implicated in human rights violations, the withdrawal of their military units, and the bringing to justice of those implicated in the atrocities.
