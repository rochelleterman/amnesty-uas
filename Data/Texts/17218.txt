 Iran: Further information on prisoners of conscience/ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Prisoners of conscience Mahboubeh Abbasgholizadeh and Shadi Sadr were released from Evin Prison, Tehran, on bail of 200 million toumans (over US$215,000) on 19 March. They are likely to face trial in the future, possibly on charges including ""disturbing public order""   and ""acting against state security"", but Amnesty International currently has no information as to whether they have yet been formally charged with any offence. They had been held in solitary confinement between 6 and 15 March.
