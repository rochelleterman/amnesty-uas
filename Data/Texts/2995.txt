 Sudan: Death Penalty/Unfair Trial | Amnesty International 
 On 12 November, five named people were sentenced to death by hanging by a Specialised Criminal Court in Nyala, South Darfur, in the western Sudan. Amnesty International is concerned that the death penalty has been imposed and that the five were condemned in an unfair trial solely on the basis of confessions extracted by torture.
