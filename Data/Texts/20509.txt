 NA 
 More than a month after a US federal judge ordered that he be released from the US detention facility at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, Chadian national Mohammed el Gharani is still being held there. Taken into custody when he was a child, he has spent nearly a third of his life in US military custody. He is alleged to have been ill-treated since the judicial order for his release was handed down. He has previously been ill-treated in Guantánamo in the context of interrogations to which he has been subjected."
