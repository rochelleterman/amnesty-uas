 USA (Missouri): Further information on death penalty: Robert T Sidebottom | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI regrets that Robert Sidebottom was executed in Missouri on 15 November. The execution took place despite the fact that his Robert Sidebottom's lawyer had argued that he should be granted a six-month delay in execution as she could not effectively represent him because she was living in Florida and was new to the case."
