 UA 285/94 - Myanmar: fear of torture / fear for safety: 16 men from Plat Hon Pai section, Kwan Saya village, Halockhani refugee camp | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There are fears for the safety of 16 men taken from a refugee camp on the Thai border by members of the Myanmar army (the tatmadaw). On 21 July 1994 360 soldiers from the 62nd Infantry Battalion entered Plat Hon Pai section, Kwan Saya village, part of the Halockhani refugee camp. They were driven back by soldiers from the armed wing of the New Mon State Party. However they returned later and torched 120 houses in the village. They then took away 16 men, some of whom were leaders of the refugee camp."
