 On 16 September 1994 a telephoned death threat was received at the offices of ASFADDES from an unidentified male caller asking for Yanette Bautista and Gloria Herney Galindez, President and Secretary-General respectively of the organization. The two women hae also reportedly been followed recently several times. These threats come at a time when the Colombian Congress and the new government are close to taking a decision regarding the draft law against ""disappearances"". ASFADDES has taken a leading role in the campaign for the new government to retract former President Gaviria's objections."
