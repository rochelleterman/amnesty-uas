 UA 323/93 - Morocco: ""disappeared"" prisoner of conscience / health concern: Abdelhaq Rouissi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Abdelhaq Rouissi, a prisoner of conscience who ""disappeared"" 29 years ago, continues to be held in a gravely deteriorating state of health. Recently received reports suggest that he continues to be detained because his health is too poor for him to be released. A former bank employee in Casablanca and an activist in the Union marocaine de travail (UMT), Moroccan Labour Union, he ""disappeared"" on 4 October 1964. Confirmation that he had been arrested and was subsequently being held in a succession of secret detention centres came over the past three decades from testimonies of former ""disappeared"" people.
