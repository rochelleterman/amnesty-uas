 There is serious concern for the safety of Bartolomeu Homem D'El-Rei Pinto, Rutonio Jorge de Sant'Anna and Solange, who are reported to have been subjected to anonymous death threats. They have been attempting to establish the whereabouts of their colleague, Marco Antonio Rufino da Cruz, who ""disappeared"" in November 1994. Although an investigation was opened into his ""disappearance"", no progress has been reported."
