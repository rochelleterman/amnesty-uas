 Hani 'Abbas Khamis and Hani Ahmed al-Wasti were reportedly killed on 17 December 1994 while taking part in demonstrations calling, among other things, for the release of Al-Shaikh 'Ali Salman. AI is concerned that they may have been unlawfully killed by the Bahrani security forces. AI remains concerned for the safety in detention of those arrested in early December."
