 Hani Muzher, a student at Bir Zeit University, was arrested on 13 July and taken to Ramallah prison for interrogation. The reasons for his arrest are unknown. He was denied access to a lawyer until 11 August 1994. AI is concerned that he has been tortured in detention and is at risk of further torture. At the meeting with his lawyer on 11 August, he claimed to have been deprived of sleep and to have been kept shackled in painful positions for long periods. He reportedly cut his wrists on 20 July in an attempt to get a break from interrogation. He was returned to interrogation after his wound had been stitched."
