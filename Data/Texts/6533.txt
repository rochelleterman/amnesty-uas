 There is concern for the safety of Jeronimo Morales Tiriquiz and Tomas Suy Canil, both members of the Council of Ethnic Communities ""We are all Equal"" (CERJ), and members of their families, all from Canton Panquiac, municipality of Chichicastenango, Quiche department. On 10 June 1993 the two men and their families were forced to take refuge due to continued persecution and death threats for not participating in the Civil Defence Patrols (PAC). In May 1993 Jeronimo Morales Tiriquiz began work on a project concerning military recruitment organized by the National Coordinating Committee of Guatemalan Widows (CONAVIGUA). "
