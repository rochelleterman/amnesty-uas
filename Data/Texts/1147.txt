 The first five people named above were arrested on 18 September 1993 at Burnt Forest town. Police alleged that they found them in possession of illegal weapons and ""seditious publications"", including publications of the National Democratic and Human Rights Organizations (NDEHURIO), founded recently by Koigi wa Wamwere. The other three were arrested later that day at the homes of Koigi wa Wamwere and Mirugi Kariuki in Nakuru, where NDEHURIO publications were also seized. They are reported to have denied possession of the weapons and it has been claimed that Koigi wa Wamwere was threatened by a police officer. They are held in Nakuru by police incommunicado in unlawful detention without charge. There is concern they may have been arrested for their human rights activities. "
