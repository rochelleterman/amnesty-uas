 Five members of the indigenous rights organization Me Phaa Indigenous Peopleâ€™s Organization were arrested on 18 April 2008 in the town of Ayutla de los Libres, Guerrero State. All are in danger of torture and ill-treatment in custody. AI believes the local authorities may be targeting them solely because of their legitimate activities on behalf of local Me Phaa indigenous communities."
