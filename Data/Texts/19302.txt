 Yemen: Fear of torture / legal concern: Mubarak Salih al-Zaydi and others | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Mubarak Salih al-Zaydi, aged about 16, was taken from his home in Sana'a by members of the al-Amn al-Siyassi (Political Security). He and others arrested with him have been held incommunicado since then and it is feared that they could be tortured. His arrest is thought to be connected with the visit to his house by people suspected by the authorities of links with the National Front for the Opposition. Mubarak Salih al-Zaydi is himself said to be connected with the Ittihad al-Qiwa al-Sha'biya, Union of Political Forces suspended in July 1995."
