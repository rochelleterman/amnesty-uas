 AI has received reports that people who assisted an international inquiry into human rights violations in Rwanda have received death threats from government and security officials. One man, Muhikira, a member of the Tutsi minority, was apparently forced to commit suicide on the night of 13 January 1993 after armed Hutu gangs surrounded his house. The gangs were reportedly accompanied by local police, who did not intervene. Muhikira was apparently targeted because his son had acted as an interpreter to the commission of inquiry. His son has reportedly fled his home. No action has apparently been taken against the gangs responsible for his father's death. "
