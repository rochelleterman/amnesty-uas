 Two children, Manilyn and Abelardo Magpatoc, and their aunt, Nenita Magpatoc, were reportedly abducted on 12 September 1993 by armed men, believed to be military or police agents, in Bitan-agen, Butuan City. The parents of Manilyn and Abelardo had previously been accused by the military of being members of the armed opposition group, the New People's Army (NPA). Relatives and members of the local community believe that they were abducted to force their parents to surrender to the military. "
