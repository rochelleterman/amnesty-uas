 Saudi Arabia: Protestors arrested in Saudi Arabia | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Around 24 men were detained on 3 and 4 March following protests in the city of al-Qatif, Saudi Arabia. They are believed to be held incommunicado and are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Amnesty International is concerned that they may be held solely for the peaceful expression of their right to freedom of expression and may therefore be prisoners of conscience."
