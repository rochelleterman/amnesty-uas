 Osman Kundes, President of the Municipality Workers' Union branch in Batman and father of six, has not been since or heard of since he was abducted in front of his house on the night of 6 February 1995. Two men reportedly drove him away in his trade union car. The car was found abandoned the following day, about 70km away. There is extreme concern for his safety."
