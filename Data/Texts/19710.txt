 On 23 October 2008, a council of Supreme Court judges confirmed the death sentences of nine people found guilty of the murder of newspaper editor Mohamed Taha, and sentenced to death by a first instance court in November 2007. The ruling followed an appeal submitted by lawyers for the nine. The Supreme Court overturned the death sentence of a tenth defendant who was 15 years old at the time of the murder."
