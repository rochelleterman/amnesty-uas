 UA 351/92 - Trinidad and Tobago: death penalty: Gayman Jurisingh, Peter Matthews, Faizal Mohammed | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The men named above were scheduled to be executed on 10 November 1992. Lawyers submitted a constitutional motion on behalf of the three, which is still being heard by the High Court. Appeals on behalf of the three had been dismissed by the Court of Appeal and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the final court of appeal. AI fears that the men could be executed in the near future. There have been no executions since 1979 in Trinidad and Tobago, where 108 prisoners are currently under sentence of death. A Comission of Inquiry recommended in 1990 that the sentences of prisoners on death row for over 10 years should be commuted: this would apply to Jurisingh and Mohammed. Peter Matthews was reportedly detained for almost 6 years before his trial in 1984. "
