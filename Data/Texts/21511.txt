 There are 155 internats (state orphanages) in the Russian Federation which are home to around 29,000 children. A    further 19,400 children up to the age of four are housed  in children's homes. A significant number of these        children have a mental disability. Parents of children    born with mental disability are often recommended to give up their child to state care at birth. If the parents     agree, they sign a document giving up their legal rights  as parents.
