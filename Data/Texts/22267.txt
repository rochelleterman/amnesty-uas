 NA 
 Kurdish women's rights activist Zeynab Bayzeydi has been sentenced to four years' imprisonment, and internal exile to the Turkish-speaking city of Zanjan, 246 km from her home, by Mahabad Revolutionary Court. Her family learned of this on 10 August 2008 when they went to the court to find out how her trial had gone. Amnesty International considers her a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for the peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of expression and association."
