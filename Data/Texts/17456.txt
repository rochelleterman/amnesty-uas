 Iran: Incommunicado detention/ Fear of torture or ill-treatment/ Possible prisoner of conscience: Sherko Jihani (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Iranian Kurdish journalist and human rights defender, Sherko Jihani, was detained on 27 November 2006 in the town of Mahabad in Kurdistan province, northwestern Iran. He is held incommunicado at an undisclosed location where he is at risk of torture or ill-treatment. He may be detained on account of his peaceful activities on behalf of the rights of Iran's Kurdish minority, in which case Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience.
