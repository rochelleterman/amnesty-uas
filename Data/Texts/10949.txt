 China: Excessive use of force/Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 On 30 September, an international group of mountaineers climbing in the Himalayas witnessed Chinese border control guards shooting at a group of Tibetans, including children, who were trying to flee to Nepal. At least two children, one of whom was Kelsang Namtso, a nun, are thought to have been killed. Nine children, thought to be aged between six and 10, and one man are known to have been detained by the Chinese authorities, and around 20 other individuals are unaccounted for. Amnesty International fears for the safety of those detained and those unaccounted for.
