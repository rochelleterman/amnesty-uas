 China: Death Penalty/Imminent execution:  Wo Weihan (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Medical scientist Wo Weihan may be at imminent risk of execution. He was sentenced to death in May 2007 for spying after a closed trial in Beijing. On 18 November the Beijing Municipal Higher People’s Court told his family to apply for visitation within seven days after being refused visitation for nearly four years. This sudden move suggests that the Supreme People’s Court (SPC) has approved the death sentence and that the Beijing Municipal Higher People’s Court is preparing to execute Wo Weihan. "
