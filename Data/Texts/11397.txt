 Indonesia: Further information on imminent arrest as prisoner of conscience: Dr George Aditjondro | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Dr George Aditjondro, a prominent Indonesian academic at Satya Wancana University, remains at risk of imminent arrest for his peaceful academic and political activities. Further to the second summons issued on 15 October 1994, with which he complied, Dr Aditjondro received a summons on 21 December. He argued, through his lawyers, that he should not, as a practising Christian, have to be questioned over the Christmas religious holiday. He received a summons on 1 January 1995 to report to the police on 7 January. However, as Dr Aditjondro may be outside the country on 7 January, it his not clear whether he will be able to comply. AI fears that the authorities may then argue that he has failed to comply to two summonses, placing him at greater risk of arrest."
