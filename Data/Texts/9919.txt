"USA (Kentucky): Legal concern, Kevin Stanford 
 USA (Kentucky): Legal concern, Kevin Stanford | Amnesty International 
 The outgoing Governor of Kentucky intends to commute the death sentence of Kevin Stanford in the next few days because he was under 18 years old at the time of the murder for which he was convicted over two decades ago. The use of the death penalty against child offenders violates a fundamental principle of international law, and Governor Patton's principled move is to be greatly welcomed. However, Amnesty International is concerned that the Governor intends to commute Kevin Stanford's death sentence to one of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, itself a violation of international law in this case.
