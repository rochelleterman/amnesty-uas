 Five staff members from the Syrian Centre for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM) remain held incommunicado at various locations across Syria. They are at risk of torture and other forms of ill-treatment.  Eight other detained staff and a visitor to the SCM face charges in military court. All 13 are believed to be prisoners of conscience, held solely for their peaceful exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and association."
