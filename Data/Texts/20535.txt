 More than two months after a US federal judge ordered that Chadian national Mohammed el Gharani be released from the US detention facility at Guant√°namo Bay in Cuba, he is still held there. Taken into custody when he was a 14-year-old child, he has spent nearly a third of his life in US military custody."
