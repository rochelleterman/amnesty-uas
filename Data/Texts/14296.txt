 Plainclothes police again came to the offices of the Kurdish-owned Ozgur Ulke on 19 january 1995. This time they took Ismail Hakki Keleci with them. It is feared that he is being interrogated under torture. The Diyarbakir State Security Court prosecutor has reportedly not been informed of his whereabouts, heightening concern for his safety. With regard to Salih Guler, a recently released detainee has reported seeing him naked and chained and apparently in poor health due to torture."
