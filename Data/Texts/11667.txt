 AI fears that Djais Adi Prayitno, his wife, Nyonya Sumiarsih and their son Sugeng, may be executed soon in East Java. East Java's police chief has said that the executions are imminent. The three were found guilty of the murder of a family of five and sentenced to death in February 1989. A fourth person convicted of the same crime, Sgt Adi Saputro, was executed in 1992. Their appeals for presidential clemency have been refused. AI opposes the death penalty in all cases and is calling for the sentences to be commuted."
