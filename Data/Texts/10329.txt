 Bangladesh: Fear of torture/Possible prisoner of conscience: Tasneem Khalil (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Journalist Tasneem Khalil was arrested on 11 May by men from the Joint (army and police) Forces. Amnesty International believes he may be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely because of his activities as a journalist and human rights defender and exposing human rights violations by the security forces, and is seriously concerned that he may be at risk of torture.
