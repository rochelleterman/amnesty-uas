 Melanie del Cármen Salgado López, an activist with human rights organisation Comité Cerezo, has been attacked by an unknown individual and threatened as she was walking home on 12 December 2007. Other members of Comité Cerezo, including Francisco, Alejandro and Emiliana Cerezo, have also received email threats since September 2007. The threats were reported to the authorities, but Amnesty International is not aware of any advances in investigations. "
