 AI is concerned for the safety of the above, a 32-year-old shopkeeper from Altinova and a father of five, who was detained on 15 May when on business in Guroymak, province of Bitlis. His detention in the street was witnessed by people who then informed his family. Reportedly, he continues to be held incommunicado at an unknown location, presumably by the gendarmerie. It is not known whether his detention has been duly registered and acknowledged by the authorities.
