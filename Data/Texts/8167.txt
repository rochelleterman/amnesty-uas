 Further information on UA 190/93 (AMR 46/21/93, 14 June) - Peru: death penalty: new death penalty law imminent | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 3 August 1993 the Peruvian Constituent Congress decided to include in the new Constitution a clause that extends the death penalty to crimes of terrorism. The new Constitution may be put to a public referendum. The new clause establishes that the death penalty can only be applied in accordance with internal laws and the international treaties to which Peru is a party. It is believed that the new law would violate the American Convention on Human Rights, ratified by Peru in 1978, which explicitly prohibits any extension of the death penalty "
