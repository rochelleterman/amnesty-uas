 NA 
 Dr Saud al-Hashimi has been on hunger strike since 1 June 2009. He is reported to be in need of medical treatment. Dr Matrouk al-Faleh was released on 10 January 2009 after more than seven months in detention without charge or trial. With the exception of Dr Matrouk al-Faleh, all those named in this document continue to be detained without charge or trial. Following their arrests in February 2007, they have been held in solitary confinement and remain at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience. "
