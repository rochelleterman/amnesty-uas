 Kazakstan: Death penalty/torture/ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Three men, Mikhail Vershinin, Evgeniy Turochkin, and Sergey Kopay, were reportedly tortured to force them to confess to a number of murders, and were sentenced to death in September 2001. An appeal against the death sentences has been lodged with the Supreme Court. Once the Supreme Court has reached a final verdict it is unlikely to change, so it is vital to put pressure on the authorities now.
