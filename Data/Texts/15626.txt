 Russian Federation: Fear of forcible return/torture and   ill-treatment/unfair trial/ death penalty: Rustam Muminov (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Uzbekistani national Rustam Muminov was detained by police on 17 October in Moscow. He is facing imminent deportation to Uzbekistan, where he faces a charge of membership of Hizb-ut-Tahrir, an Islamic organization which is banned in Uzbekistan and Russia. Amnesty International is concerned that if Rustam Muminov is returned to Uzbekistan, he will be at high risk of torture and ill-treatment, and may even be sentenced to death after an unfair trial.
