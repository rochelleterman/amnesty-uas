 The three journalists named above, who work for the daily newspaper al-Sudani al-Doulia, are reported to have been arrested on 4 April 1994 in Khartoum, accused of spreading ""false news"". The government has taken action to close the paper. They are believed to be prisoners of conscience, arrested because of their professional activities. Their whereabouts are unknown and there are fears that the three may be at risk of torture while in detention. Mahjoub Mohamed al-Hassan Erwa is also a member of the Transitional National Assembly."
