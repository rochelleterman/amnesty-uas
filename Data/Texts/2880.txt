 Mamoun Elyas Mohammed Ahmed, a former police officer, who was working as a public relations officer in the Saudi Arabian embassy in Khartoum, was arrested in late August 1993. He is reportedly detained without charge, but appears to have been arrested on suspicion of spying for the Saudi Arabian Government. It is not known where he is being held, and he has reportedly been tortured in custody. "
