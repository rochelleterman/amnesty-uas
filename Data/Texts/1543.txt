 UA 16/94 - Niger: extrajudicial executions / fear for safety: Warghiss Founta, Karbey Moussa | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Warghiss Founta and Karbey Moussa, of Tuareg ethnic origin, were killed by security forces on 24 December 1993. There is concern the two men, who were market gardeners, may have been targeted on account of their ethnic group. They were reportedly killed by the army near Agades, while they were travelling to the market to sell their goods. The soldiers apparently suspected them of involvement in the theft of a vehicle. The Mayor of Agades has lodged a complaint, but it is not known whether an inquiry has been initiated."
