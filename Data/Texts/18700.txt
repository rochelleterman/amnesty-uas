 Syria: Fear of torture/incommunicado detention/prisoners  of conscience | Amnesty International 
 The security forces have arrested the two leading members of a newly-established support group for the families of prisoners of conscience. The two men are held incommunicado, which puts them at grave risk of torture. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience, arrested solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression.
