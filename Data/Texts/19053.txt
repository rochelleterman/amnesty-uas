 UA 69/94 - Tunisia: health concern / torture: Hamma Hammami | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for Hamma Hammami, who was arrested on 14 February and tortured for the first two days, both at Sousse Police Station and at the Ministry of the Interior in Tunis. Following this torture he fainted and fell unconscious for several hours, and is still suffering from headaches and dizziness. Repeated requests by his family and lawyers for a medical examination have not been met. In addition, he suffers from kidney stones and a heart condition, for which he needs to take regular medecine. His family have not been allowed to bring him this medecine. There is also concern that he is being held in overcrowded and insanitary conditions in Sousse Prison."
