 Nepal: Further information on: Fear for safety/ legal concern, Raj Kumar Pariyar | Amnesty International 
 Raj Kumar Pariyar was freed on 24 August following a second Supreme Court ruling that his detention was illegal and that he should be released immediately. However, lawyers and human rights defenders recognized members of the security forces dressed in plain clothes waiting outside the Supreme Court building and feared that he could be re-arrested once again. Raj Kumar Pariyar remained inside the court until representatives of Nepal's National Human Rights Commission arrived on the scene and escorted him to safety.
