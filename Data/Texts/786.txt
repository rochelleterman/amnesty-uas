 The four people named above are among many members of the Oromo ethnic group detained in recent weeks. All four are being held incommunicado and without any charge; they appear to be detained for alleged links with the Oromo Liberation Front, currently in a state of virtual war with the transitional government of Ethiopia. Arega Kitata is reportedly held in a secret ""safe house"". Tilahun Hirpassa (previously detained under the Mengistu regime), Wolde-Yesus Mengesha and Haile Legesse are reportedly held in Ambo Prison. They are being held outside any legal framework. AI fears that they may be at risk of ill-treatment in incommunicado detention. "
