 Guatemala: Fear for Safety /Death threat | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of the three rural workers leaders Luis Ch‡vez (m), Gilmar Vallejos Vel‡squez (m) ] and Eleodoro Chums (m) named above, who have all recently received death threats. The men believe the threats are reactions to their efforts to organise rural peasant farmers, who are claiming their rights to gain access to cultivable land or to retain plots they are already cultivating, but whose title has been challenged.
