 Pakistan: Further information on fear for safety / death penalty: John Joseph, Salamat Masih aged 14, Rehmat Masih | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI continues to fear for the safety of all those associated with the blasphemy case in which Salamat Masih, aged 14, and Rehmat Masih were sentenced to death on 9 February 1995. As well as the three people named in the original action, Islamists have made threats against human rights lawyer Asma Jahangir, who is defending the two Christians and is filing an appeal. AI is also concerned for the safety of Salamat Masih and Rehmat Masih in Kot Lakhpat Jail, Lahore, where another Christian, Tahir Iqbal, died in mysterious circumstances in 1992. The safety of John Joseph, a key witness to the murder of Manzoor Masih, remains a matter of serious concern."
