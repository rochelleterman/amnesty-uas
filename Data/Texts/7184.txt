 Fears for the safety of people detained by the Mexican Federal Judicial Police in the past few days have been heightened by allegations that one of them has been tortured in custody. On 12 February it was reported that Maria Gloria Guevara Niebla was tortured between 8 and 9 February and forced to sign a confession. She was reportedly threatened with the torture of her two-year-old son. The detainees are reported to be members of the EZLN."
