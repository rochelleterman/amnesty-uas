 Spain: Fear of forcible return/Fear of torture or ill-treatment :Murad Gasayev | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Spanish authorities are preparing to extradite Murad Gasayev to the Russian Federation where he would be at risk of an unfair trial, torture and other ill-treatment. If the extradition goes ahead, it will violate Spainâ€™s obligations under international human rights law, including the UN Convention against Torture. The Spanish government must now approve the extradition in order for it to go ahead."
