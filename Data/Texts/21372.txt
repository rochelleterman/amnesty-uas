 Amnesty International has recently learned that Iranian Kurdish refugee Ayoub Parniyani was forcibly returned to Iraq on 19 October 2007, along with his wife and son. He claims that the Turkish authorities threatened to send them to Iran instead, and forced him to sign a document in Turkish that he could not read. All three were detained on arrival in northern Iraq. Aysha Khaeirzade and Komas Parniyani were released after two days, while Ayoub Parniyani was held for 20 days."
