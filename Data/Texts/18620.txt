 Syria : Further information on: Fear of torture/incommunicado detention: 'Abd al-Rahman al-Musa | Amnesty International 
 'Abd al-Rahman al-Musa was allowed to see his family once during April, for the first time in several weeks. Amnesty International does not have information about where he is held and is concerned that he may be in danger of torture or other ill-treatment. There are also concerns that he has not had access to a lawyer, is being held without charge, and has not been brought before a court.
