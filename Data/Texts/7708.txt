 All of the above-named were relased on 18 April 1995, except for 12-year-old Anselmo Acosta, who was released into the custody of a local indigenous landowner. He was returned to his family on 27 April. Proceedings in connection with the case continue in the Attorney General's office in Veraguas province.
