 Ayatollah Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi continues to be held in Evin Prison in Tehran, where his medical condition has gravely deteriorated. He and his detained followers may be prisoners of conscience, held only because of their religious beliefs. Of the 77 followers of Ayatollah Boroujerdi who also faced trial, most have now been released although Habib Ghovati received a four year prison sentence. The sentences and whereabouts of two other followers, Ali Shahrabi Farahani and Ahmad Karimiyan, remain unknown. Four other followers, Majid Alasti, Mehrdad Souri, Mohammad-Reza Sadeghi and Massoud Samavatiyan, had their sentences upheld. "
