 NA 
 The Pennsylvania Superior Court has ruled against a lower court decision not to transfer Jordan Brownâ€™s case to juvenile court for trial and has ordered a new transfer hearing. The Acting State Attorney General, who had until 10 April to appeal the ruling, did not do so. He should now drop his pursuit of an adult trial for Jordan Brown. "
