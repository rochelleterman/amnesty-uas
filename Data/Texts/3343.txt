 Democratic Republic of Congo: POCs/Legal concern/risk of ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Modeste Mutinga, Andre Ipakala, Docteur Kambamba Mbwebwe  and Marie-Ange Lukiana have been imprisoned in the        capital, Kinshasa, after they were accused of             collaborating with enemies of the Congolese authorities.  It is feared that they risk torture and may be denied     full legal rights. Amnesty considers all four to be       prisoners of consocience.
