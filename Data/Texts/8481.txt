 Charles Stamper is scheduled to be executed in Virginia on 19 January 1993. He had previously been granted a stay of execution to allow information about his poor medical condition to be considered as grounds for clemency: on 9 January 1993 Governor Wilder announced his decision to deny clemency. Stamper, black, was sentenced to death for the murder of two white men and a woman during a robbery in 1978. He is partially paralysed as a result of a fight with another death row prisoner in 1988. If executed, he will have to be taken to the death chamber in a wheelchair. "
