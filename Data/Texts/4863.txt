On 4 July paramilitaries allegedly killed three civil servants, Luis Jose Lemus Sanchez, Segundo Vasquez and Otoniel Canizares Jacome. There is also serious concern for the safety of members of non-governmental peasant farmer and human rights organizations who have been supporting the peasant farmers in their claims.
