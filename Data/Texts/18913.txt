 UA 417/94 - Algeria: fear of torture / legal concern: Abdelkrim Mammeri | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Abdelkrim Mammeri, Head of Personnel at the Ministry of Justice, was arbitrarily arrested at his home on 12 November 1994 by four men, two in military police uniforms, two in civilian clothing. They reportedly ill-treated members of his fmaily, searched his flat and took some money before leaving with him. He has not been seen since and his whereabouts and legal status remain unknown, despite inquiries made to the authorities. He is at serious risk of torture, and there is concern that his incommunicado detention, which has already exceeeded the 12-day maximum permitted under Algerian law, may be extended."
