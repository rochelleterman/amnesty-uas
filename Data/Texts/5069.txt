 UA 349/93 - Colombia: legal concern / fear for safety: Ricardo Esquivia Ballestas | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 According to reports received from the Evangelical Mennonite Church of Colombia, Ricardo Esquivia Ballestas has reportedly been accused by the Administrative Security Department (DAS), of being a member of the Popular Liberation Army (EPL), and of involvement in the murder of a Spanish priest, Javier Cirujano Arjona. Ricardo Ballestas is director of the Centre for Justice, Peace and Non-violent Action - JUSTAPAZ. The Mennonite Church believe the accusations are designed to undermine his human rights work at JUSTAPAZ. There are fears the attempts to link him with guerrilla groups and with the killing of the priest may lead to his wrongful arrest and possible extrajudicial execution. "
