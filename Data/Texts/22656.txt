 Saudi Arabia: Further information: Detained protestors remain at risk | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Khaled al-‘Omair and Mohammed al-‘Otaibi remain in detention and are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. They were detained in Saudi Arabia after taking part in, or attempting to demonstrate against Israel’s military action in Gaza. They appear to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of assembly."
