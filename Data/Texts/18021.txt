 Walid Jassem Mahdi, an Iraqi sentenced to death by the State Security Court on 19 June 1993, has had his sentence commuted. The Court of Cassation decided on 18 April 1994 not to uphold his death sentence, and to reverse his conviction on charges of ""collaboration"". However, prison sentences of 10 and 5 years on other charges were upheld."
