 Deogratias Sindaruhunga is still being held at the military camp in Bubanza. He is not reported to have been subjected to any ill-treatment. Since his arrest and transfer to the camp in December 1994, he has not been transferred to civilian custody or charged with a criminal offence. Soldiers have reportedly requested the equivalent of UK Âœ1000 in return for his release and have threatened that upon release he must leave the country immediately."
