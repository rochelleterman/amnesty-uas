 On 1 December 1992, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal against the death sentence imposed on L Lingam in 1991. He had been convicted of trafficking in heroin. His case will now be reviewed by the Pardons Board for the Federal Territory, which will pass its recommendations to the King, the last avenue of appeal for clemency. "
