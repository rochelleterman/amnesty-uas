 Sesela Mato Afoa was sentenced to death in March 1994 for taking part in the murder of Nuutai Fatiala Mafulu on 25 September 1993 in the village of Lona, Fagaloa district. Mafulu was a village chief who had recently returned to the village after 20 years in exile. He was apparently executed on the orders of the village council according to traditional customs. Six chiefs were due to be tried in March on charges of inciting or procuring the death of Mafulu."
