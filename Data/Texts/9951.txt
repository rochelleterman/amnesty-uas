 Coleman Gray, black, is scheduled to be executed in Virginia on 14 December 1995. He was convicted in December 1985 of abduction and murder. The prosecutor at the sentencing phase of his trial reportedly presented information to the jury linking Gray to other murders for which he had never been charged, and in which he can reportedly prove that he was not involved. There is concern that this information may have affected the jury's decision to impose the death sentence."
