 Yemen: Fear of imminent execution / legal concern: Muhammad Ahmad Mislah al-Nadhiri | Amnesty International 
 On 31 March 1997 Muhammad Ahmad Mislah al-Nadhiri, a 48-year-old building contractor, was sentenced to death and crucifixion after a single trial hearing lasting approximately four hours. On 2 April the Court of Appeal upheld his sentence. There are fears that his execution may be imminent and that his trial may have fallen short of international standards for a fair trial. Amnesty International is urging that his death sentence be commuted.
