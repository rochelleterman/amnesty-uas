 The case of the four named Rwandese men is currently before the Bujumbura Court of Appeals. They were arrested on 31 January, following a bank robbery in the Burundian capital, Bujumbura two days earlier. They were found guilty of stealing a considerable amount of money, shooting and killing a driver transporting money for the bank, wounding a soldier by shooting him in the leg and the theft of a getaway vehicle. All however, have denied the charges against them.
