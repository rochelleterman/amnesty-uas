 Guatemala: Fear for safety/death threats | Amnesty International 
 Staff at the office of the non-governmental organisation Donde est艱 los ni핦s y las ni하s? (Where are the children?) have reportedly been threatened and assaulted in a pattern of escalating violence apparently intended to prevent the organisation from continuing its work. It is investigating the circumstances in which children were adopted after they were separated from their parents during Guatemala's civil war, an issue in which senior military officers are implicated. Amnesty International is concerned that their lives are in danger, as 18 other human rights defenders have been killed so far this year after similar intimidation and threats.
