 Tempa Rabgye, Kinzang Dorji: There is concern that the two men named above may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment in police custody. Tempa Rabgye, a 29-year-old religious teacher from Gomdar Shugang Monastery, Samdrup Jonkhar district was arrested on 26 July. Kinzang Dorji, a 37-year-old religious teacher from Kheri Gompa Monastery, Pema Gatshel district was arrested on 27 July. They are believed to be held incommunicado at Samdrup Jonkhar police station. They are reportedly members of the Druk National Congress (DNC), a political organization set up in exile in Nepal, and are supporters of Rongthong Kunley Dorji, the founder of the DNC, who is currently detained in India at risk of extradition to Bhutan.
