 Canada: Further Information on possible prisoner of conscience, Matthew Lowell (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Matthew Lowell has been allowed to stay in Canada until the countryâ€™s Federal Court decides whether or not to review his case. He had been due to be deported to the USA on 28 October. He fled to Canada in October 2005 because of his conscientious objection to the war in Iraq and his objection to serving in the United States army. If deported to the USA, he risks being court-martialled and imprisoned for between one and five years and would therefore be a prisoner of conscience."
