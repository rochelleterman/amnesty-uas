 Around 28 August, Qi Zhiyong, who lost both his legs during the suppression of the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was taken from his home in Beijing into police custody. No arrest warrant was shown, but his relatives believe that his arrest is linked in some way to the Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women, currently underway in Beijing. On 5 September, the veteran dissident Xu Shuiliang, was taken from his home in Nanjing, to serve a 15 day administrative detention order in a police detention centre. He is believed to be suffering from a heart complaint and high blood pressure. Friends believe that this order was issued to prevent him from undertaking any kind of action during the Conference. Ding Zilin and Jiang Peikun have reportedly been held in Procurate premises in Wuxi, Jiangsu province since 18 August. They have not been permitted visits from relatives since then."
