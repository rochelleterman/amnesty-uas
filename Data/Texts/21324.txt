 On 17 December 2010, the authorities of Cluj, in north-western Romania, forcibly evicted a Roma community. Some of the families have been moved to housing units that do not meet the criteria of adequate housing, while others are homeless. According to local NGOs and testimonies from local Roma, other Roma communities in Cluj are at risk of being forcibly evicted. "
