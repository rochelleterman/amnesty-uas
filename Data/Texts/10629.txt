 NA 
   Amnesty International has recently received reports     that Tsultrim Dargye,  Tamdring Tsering,  Ashar (or Aka)  Dhargye, Tashi Phuntsok,  Tserang Dondrup, Choetsom,      Pasang,   Tashi Phuntsok,   Tserang Dondrup,  Choetsom,   and  Pasang    were detained in connection with the case  against Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche and Lobsang Dhondup. Five   of them have since been released, reportedly after being  tortured or ill-treated in detention, but five others are believed to remain in custody. Two other monks,           interrogated by police in connection with the case, have  not been seen since 8 April 2002. There are fears that    they may have ""disappeared"".
