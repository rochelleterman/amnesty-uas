 Russia (Chechen Republic): Further information on appeal for respect of humanitarian law: Introduction of death penalty for ""illegal armed formations"" moves a step closer | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 10 March 1995, it was reported that the State Duma had overridden a resolution by the Federation Council which had rejected the State Duma vote to introduce legislation punishing the organization of or participation in ""illegal armed formations"". The proposed legislation provides for the imposition of the death penalty for this offence if it is accompanied by ""mass violence, the death of people or other serious damage"". The proposed amendment now goes to President Yeltsin for signing into law: he has 14 days in which to sign it or to return it for further examination. AI's concern about this issue lies in the extension of the scope of the death penalty, which the organization opposes in all cases."
