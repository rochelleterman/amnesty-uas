 Major Niranjan Basnet of the Nepal Army was charged by a civilian court in 2008 with the murder of a 15-year-old girl. He was recently found to be serving in a UN peacekeeping mission in Africa; the UN have now expelled him from the mission, and have instructed the government of Nepal to repatriate him. It is now possible to bring him to justice."
