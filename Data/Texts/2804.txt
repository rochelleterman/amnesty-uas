 Sudan: Fear for Safety/Fear of Torture/Fear of Extrajudicial Execution	 | Amnesty International 
 Suleiman Jamous, formerly humanitarian coordinator in an armed opposition group in Darfur, has been held incommunicado in North Darfur by the leader of another faction of the same armed group since 20 May. Others held by the same faction in the past have been tortured or killed. A member of Suleiman Jamous's faction, Isa Ali Hassabullah, is still detained and has reportedly been tortured. UN and African Union monitors have been unable to gain access and Amnesty International is now gravely concerned for the men's safety.
