 Some 25 men, including the above-named, were abducted from a train on 27 February 1993 at the village of Strpci, just inside Bosnia-Herzegovina, by men in the uniform of the police of the self-proclaimed ""Serbian Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina"". The above-named men are reportedly Muslims from Prijepolje, Bijelo Polje, Bar and Podgorica in Montenegro. Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina were reportedly also abducted, possibly to punish them for failing to take up arms with Serb forces in Bosnia. "
