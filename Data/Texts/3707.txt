 Bermuda: death penalty: Rudolph Leroy West (includes correction) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned that Rudolph Leroy West may be executed at any time after 22 August 1995. He was sentenced to death on 1 August 1995 for the murder of his estranged wife. He is reported to have attempted suicide three times since his arrest. No psychiatric report was carried out to determine his mental state at the time he committed the offence. West has 21 days to appeal. His guilty appeal was reportedly based on a confession statement. AI opposes the death penalty in all cases and is calling for this death sentence to be commuted."
