 Israel-Lebanon: Stop killings of civilians | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is gravely concerned that civilians continue to bear the brunt of the mounting tension between Israel and Lebanon.  In the past week some 300 Lebanese civilians, including dozens of children, have been killed and hundreds injured in a large-scale bombing campaign by Israeli forces, who have also deliberately targeted and destroyed dozens of bridges, roads, powers stations, the airport and port, and other civilian facilities and infrastructure."
