 NA 
 There is serious concern about Olegario Romero Rodriguez, who has not been seen since 6 June 1995. His family have officially denounced his ""disappearance"". The area near where he was last seen, Vereda Lagunitas, in Cundinamarca department, is known as a Zona Roja and is heavily militarized as a result of the activities of armed opposition groups."
