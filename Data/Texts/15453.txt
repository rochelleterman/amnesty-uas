"United Kingdom: Cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment / health concern: Roisin McAliskey (f) 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned that the conditions of detention in which Roisin McAliskey is being held, may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. She was detained in Northern Ireland on 20 November 1996 and remanded in custody on an extradition warrant issued by the German authorities in connection with an Irish Republican Army mortar attack on a British Army base in Germany. She is six to seven months pregnant and suffers from various medical ailments including asthma and an eating disorder. There is concern that she is being strip-searched twice a day and is reportedly restricted to taking exercise on the roof of the prison.
