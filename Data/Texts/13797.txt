 Viet Nam: Further Information on: Health concern / Incommunicado detention / Unfair trial / Prisoner of conscience, Dr Nguyen Dan Que [m] | Amnesty International 
 Dr Nguyen Dan Que has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years' imprisonment following a grossly unfair trial, which took place at Ho Chi Minh City People's Court on 29 July. Amnesty International is appalled by this sentence, which was imposed despite a wave of international protest, and is urging the Vietnamese authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Dr Que as a prisoner of conscience.
