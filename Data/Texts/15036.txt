 AI has obtained a statement from Faruk Durre describing what happened to him after he was detained in Adana on 27 January 1995 in which he claims he was badly tortured and kept in police custody for 14 days before being taken to prison where he was beaten after being involved in a prison dispute. Durre has now been charged under Article 168/2 of the Turkish Penal Code but there are continued fears for his safety."
