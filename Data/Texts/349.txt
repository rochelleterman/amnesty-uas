 Evariste Menouga, Peter William Mandio, Daniel Atangana: Peter William Mandio was released without charge on 16 December 1996. Evariste Menouga was released without charge on 19 December 1996. Daniel Atangana was also released without charge on 29 December 1996. Amnesty International remains concerned that these men were arbitrarily arrested and held in unlawfully prolonged detention without charge in what appears to have been an attempt to inhibit criticism of the government.
