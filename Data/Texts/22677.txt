 According to a report in the al-Riyadh newspaper, the Saudi Arabian Minister of Interior has ordered that sentences of flogging and imprisonment imposed on a 75-year-old Syrian woman and two Saudi Arabian men be carried out. Flogging violates the absolute prohibition against torture and other ill-treatment; the three will be prisoners of conscience if they are imprisoned. "
