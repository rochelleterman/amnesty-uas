 Jordan: Further information on  Prisoner of conscience/health concern/ill-treatment/unfair   trial | Amnesty International 
 On 26 June, Toujan al-Faisal was released from the King Hussein Medical Centre in the capital Amman. This follows a private amnesty by Royal Decree from His Majesty King Abdullah. Members of the Jordanian Chechen-Circassian community had appealed for her release during a meeting with the Prime Minister. However, Amnesty International is concerned that her conviction remains in force despite her release.
