 On 26 December 1993 the above ten former communist party officials, members of the ""politburo"", were found guilty by Tirana Court of ""violating the equality of citizens"" by granting themselves priveleges while they were in power. They received sentences of between six and eight years' imprisonment and ordered to make repayments to the state. At the end of the trial the president of the court lifted the ban on press reporting of the trial. Despite this, there has still been little reporting of the case, and there is little information available about the specific charges and the evidence."
