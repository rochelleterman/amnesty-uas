 Uzbekistan: Death penalty/fear for safety/unfair trial/forcible deportation: Bakhadir Ruzmetov | Amnesty International 
 Bakhadir Ruzmetov was returned to Uzbekistan from the     Russian Federation.  He reportedly faces a death sentence for perpetrating acts of terrorism in respect of          explosions which took place in Tashkent in February.      This incident is an example of the Russian Federation's   failure  to provide adequate protection to those facing   grave violations of their human rights if returned to     their own country.  Amnesty International fears that      Bakhadir Ruzmetov will face torture or ill treatment and  may face execution after an unfair trial.
