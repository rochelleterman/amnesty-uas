 Mexico: State of Guerrero: Legal concern/""Disappearance""/Impunity

 The governing Congress in the state of Guerrero is        considering a bill that would criminalize ""forced         disappearance"" (when someone is clandestinely deprived of their liberty by the authorities or their agents, with    the authorization, support or acquiescence of the state)  to bring the state legislation into line with             international human rights standards. The bill may fail   because it is not supported by the congressional Justice  Commission, which must give its approval before the bill  can be put to a vote in the Congress. Amnesty             International believes that appeals from the              international community would show Congress members that  there is widespread international support for such        legislation."
