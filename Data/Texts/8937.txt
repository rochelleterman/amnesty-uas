 USA (Virginia): Further information on death penalty: Joseph O'Dell | Amnesty International 
 Joseph O'Dell is scheduled to be executed in Virginia on 23 July 1997 after the rejection of his appeal by the US Supreme Court on 19 June, despite continuing serious doubts about his guilt. There is also concern that he was unable to benefit from a new legal standard set by the US Supreme Court in 1994 because of the Court's refusal to make the standard retroactive.
