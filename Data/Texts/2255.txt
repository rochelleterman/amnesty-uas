 Vusi Tshabalala, assistant secretary of Thokoza Civic Association, was shot dead on 27 October 1992 while walking with a friend in Thokoza township. At least 17 other political and township activists have been killed by gunmen apparently operating with impunity in Thokoza, about 30 km east of Johannesburg. The friend who witnessed the shooting has now gone into hiding. He has refused to make a statement to the police for fear of becoming more vunerable to attack. There are fears that these gunmen are acting under instruction from elements within the police. Louis Sibeko, general secretary of Thokoza Civic Association, has had to go into hiding several times because strangers have been seen outside his home, apparently keeping it under surveillance. "
