 Danilo Jara, alleged to be a common criminal, was detained by three uniformed police officers on 31 October in Quito. Immediately following his arrest, he was reportedly kicked and beaten with a tyre spanner. On 2 November he was taken to the Oficina de Investigacion del Delito, OID, Office of Crime Investigation in Quito, to be questioned. There he was kept handcuffed and blindfolded, and was subjected to torture. A forensic doctor attached to the Office of the General Attorney of the State, saw him and reportedly told an independent human rights organization that he had been severely beaten."
