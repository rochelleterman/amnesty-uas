 Up to 150 Oromo students, including Mohammad Jamal; Tita Gonfa; Dula Raggasa; Derese Furgasa; Badada Bayene; Damte Danye; Tolasa Dabala; Tuli Bayisa, and a large number of other Oromo students from Addis Ababa University have been in police custody since 22 December 2000. Only 18 were brought to court and charged within 48 hours, as required by law, and Amnesty International fears that the students, particularly those not yet taken to court, may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment.
