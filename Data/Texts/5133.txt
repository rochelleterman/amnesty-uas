 Death threats against and surveillance of Josue Giraldo Cardona, Pedro Malagon, Nelson Viloria and Jamis Ricardo Barrera have reportedly increased recently. Fears for the safety of the four, all activists of the Union Patriotica (UP) party, have been heightened by the possible ""disappearance"" of UP sympathizer Enrique Hurtado. He has not been seen since 13 August 1994."
