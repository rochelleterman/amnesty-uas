 Dr Falomo, Moshood Abiola's personal physician, was reportedly detained by the security police on 20 April 1995. He is being held incommunicado. No reason has been given for the arrest, but it is believed to be because he has recently publicized Moshood Abiolo'as deteriorating health and poor prison conditions. He is a prisoner of conscience. Another physician who has treated him, Dr Charles Ugboma, a police doctor, is also reported to have been arrested and is also being held incommunicado."
