 Colombia: Women rights defenders' lives in danger | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 7 May 2012, shots were fired into the office of a women’s rights organization in Bogota, Colombia. This follows a series of attacks and intimidation against human rights defender Monica Roa and her colleagues. It is believed these attacks are in retaliation for their work in favour of women’s sexual and reproductive rights in Colombia. Their lives could be in danger."
