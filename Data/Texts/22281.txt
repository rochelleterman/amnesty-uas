 Iran: Further Information on Arbitrary arrest/fear of torture or other ill-treatment/prisoner of conscience:  Mahboubeh Karami (f)  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 25 August 2008, Mahboubeh Karami was released on bail of one billion rials (approximately US$110,000). She was charged in mid-August with ""acting against national security"" and her next hearing is scheduled for 1 November at the Revolutionary Court in Tehran. Since her arrest on 13 June she had been held in Evin Prison, Tehran. Amnesty International considers the charge against her to be false and if imprisoned Mahboubeh Karami would be a prisoner of conscience, detained for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression and association."
