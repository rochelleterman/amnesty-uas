 NA 
 Environmental activists Maria Elena Foronda and Oscar Diaz Barboza, working for the non-governmental organization, Instituto Natura, were reportedly detained on 13 September 1994, apparently on suspicion of having links to the armed opposition. It is believed that these accusations are without foundation and that they are prisoners of conscience. There is concern that they may be tortured in detention, and that if charged they may face an unfair trial."
