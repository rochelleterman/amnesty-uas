 The four people named above have been arrested in Lahore. AI believes that they are prisoners of conscience, detained solely for their work for the liberation of bonded labour in Pakistan, particularly child labour, and for having published reports holding carpet-makers responsible for the murder of child activist Iqbal Masih on 16 April 1995. AI is appealing for their immediate and unconditional release."
