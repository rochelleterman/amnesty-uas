 Ivo Rodriguez Escudero, a student at the University of Carabobo, has reportedly received death threats from members of the security police. On 2 February 1993, three armed men reportedly threatened to kill him if he continued to denounce the torture he suffered while in the custody of the Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services, after the attempted coup of November 1993. Injuries consistent with his allegations were found by a forensic doctor who was a delegate on an AI visit to Venezuela in January 1993."
