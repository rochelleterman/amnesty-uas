 UA 334/92 - Haiti: legal concern / fear of torture: Innocent Merat and one other, name unknown | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Innocent Merat, a farmer, and one other man were arrested on 21 October 1992, without warrant, on the orders of the armed forces in Gros Morne, Artibonite Department. They were taken first to Gros Morne Prison and then to Gonaives Prison. They have reportedly not yet been brought before a judge to be charged. Their arrest is said to be linked to their work in a community education project for underprivileged families, undertaken at the request of the local mayor and congressional representative of Gros Morne (both members of the pro-Aristide National Front for Change and Democracy, FNCD). Members of the armed forces have reportedly accused those involved in the project of being associated with the Lavalas political group, which supports former President Aristide. "
