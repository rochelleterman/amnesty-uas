 Russian Federation: Lawyer in Dagestan still at risk: Sapiyat Magomedova: Further information | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Sapiyat Magomedova, a lawyer from Dagestan, Russia, had the travel restrictions against her lifted in mid-October. Our Urgent Action on 7 October led to an unprecedented show of solidarity by other lawyers. However, she still faces criminal charges following her allegations that she was severely beaten by police, and may be at risk of further harassment."
