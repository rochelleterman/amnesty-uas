 UA 379/92 - Myanmar (Burma): prisoner of conscience / health concern: Daw Aung San Suu Kyi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about the well-being of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a founder member of the National League for Democracy held under house arrest without charge or trial since July 1989. She has been held incommunicado for most of that time, apart from two brief visits from her family earlier this year. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has consistently refused to accept food and other necessities from the authorities and her own resources are now believed to be running out. She has been refused access to a doctor of her choice. AI fears that her health may now deteriorate. "
