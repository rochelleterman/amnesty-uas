 Kurdish political activist Mustafa Jum’ah has been held in incommunicado detention since his arrest by Military Intelligence officers on 10 January. He is believed to be still in the custody of Military Intelligence, possibly, according to some reports, at the Far’ Falastin interrogation and detention centre in Damascus. Far’ Falastin is notorious for torture and Mustafa Jum’ah is at serious risk."
