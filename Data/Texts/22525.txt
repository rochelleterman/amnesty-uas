 Fathi el-Jahmi is receiving medical treatment, according to a statement issued on 6 February 2008 by the Gaddafi Development Foundation (GDF), but Amnesty International remains concerned about whether the care is adequate to treat his deteriorating state of health, and by the GDF’s announcement that he has been declared “mentally unstable”."
