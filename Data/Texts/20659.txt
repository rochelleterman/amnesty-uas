 Mexican national José Medellín was executed in Texas on the evening of 5 August 2008 in violation of the USA’s international legal obligations and despite worldwide appeals for the execution to be stopped, including from the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. On 4 August, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles unanimously voted against recommending that the state governor commute the death sentence or a grant a reprieve."
