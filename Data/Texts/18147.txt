 Libya: Forcible return/Torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Some 70 Eritrean nationals who had fled Eritrea to seek refuge abroad are reportedly being held in a detention facility in the Libyan town of Az Zawiyah, some 40km west of the capital, Tripoli, and at risk of imminent forcible return. If sent back to Eritrea, they would be at risk of torture and other serious human rights violations.
