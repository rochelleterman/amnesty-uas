Following discussions with the authorities, the six said they had agreed to stop their hunger strike and leave Cuba if they were released, and if no further action was taken against others who had fasted with them or supported their action.However, since 24 February, three of the six have been returned to prison and another has been transferred to a psychiatric hospital.Two others have been sent home and told to report to a work centre to carry out their sentences of ""correctional work"". All six are said to have commenced a full hunger strike in protest at the new action against them.
