 Twenty-four East Timorese youths have been detained during a pro-democracy demonstration on 9 January 1995 at the Univeristy of East Timor in Dili. Two were allegedly badly beaten on arrest, heightening fears that the detainees may be ill-treated in custody. AI is concerned that some may have been detained solely for the peaceful expression of their beliefs."
