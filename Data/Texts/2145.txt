 On 14 January Johannes Setlae was formally charged at Mmabatho police station with assaulting a police officer, and released on bail. His case has been postponed to March 1994. There is concern that while he was in custody his lawyer was initially prevented from seeing him. He has also alleged that the police who arrested him had threatened him with death, although he was not assaulted at the station. Furthermore, he alleges that in custody he was refused medical treatment for the injuries he sustained when assaulted prior to his arrest."
