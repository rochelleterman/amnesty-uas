 Mexico: Victimsâ€™ family burgled, in danger | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Five members of a family in western Mexico were subjected to enforced disappearance in the early 1970s. The rest of the family have been seeking truth and justice; their home was burgled on 29 November, and some of their paperwork about the enforced disappearances was stolen. The family is now in danger."
