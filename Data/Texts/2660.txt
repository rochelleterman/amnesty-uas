 Ezekiel Kodi, former regional minister; Joshua Dau Diu, former civil servant; Kwai Malak, teacher: Amnesty International has received reports that the three men named above were arrested in early February 1997 and are being detained without charge or trial in Khartoum.

Amnesty International fears that they may be prisoners of conscience at risk of torture and ill-treatment.
