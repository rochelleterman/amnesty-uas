 USA (Mississippi): Further information on Death penalty / Legal concern: Bobby Glen Wilcher | Amnesty International 
 Bobby Wilcher, white, aged 44, who suffers from mental illness, is scheduled for execution in Mississippi at 6pm local time on 18 October 2006. On 16 October, his lawyer filed an appeal in the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit seeking a stay of execution in order that he can pursue appeals which Bobby Wilcher had previously decided to give up after more than two decades on death row. So far the courts have denied Wilcher's request to retract the waiver of his appeals.
