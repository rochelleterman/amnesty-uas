 Indonesia: Indonesian students face forced eviction | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 An estimated 900 students from a Christian college in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, are facing imminent forced eviction from a temporary site where they have been living and studying. At least 17 students are on hunger strike. The authorities in Jakarta have not offered the students suitable alternative accommodation, so they may be forced to sleep out in the open. "
