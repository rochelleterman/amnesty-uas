 NA 
 On 2 November 1994 the district court of Durres sentenced R Domi, 40, to death for murder. R. Domi claimed at trial that he had killed the man in self-defence. According to reports, the sentence was unexpected as the prosecution had called for a 25-year sentence and the defence had requested a lower sentence in view of various extenuating circumstances (not specified)."
