 Ethiopia: Further information on medical concern / prisoner of conscience: Berhanu Negga (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has learnt that Dr Berhanu Negga has now been moved to a less crowded and better ventilated cell in Kaliti prison in Addis Ababa, in compliance with a High Court ruling on 19 July. He is now in a cell which holds about 35 prisoners, unlike his previous cell which held 270 prisoners. Detention conditions remain harsh but it is thought that this development will help to ensure that Dr Berhanu Negga's health remains stable.
