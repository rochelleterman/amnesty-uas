 Jorge Enrique Illera Dodino, Oscar Becerra and about 10 other civic and community leaders in the municipalities of Convencion and El Carmed are reported to be on a ""death list"". The list is alleged to have been drawn up by the Departament Administrativo de Seguridad (DAS) and then supplied to a paramilitary group operating in the region. Jorge Enrique Illera Dodino, a human rights activist, was detained several times in the mid-1980s and subjected to torture and threats. A denunciation of the ""death list"" has been presented to the relevant authorities."
