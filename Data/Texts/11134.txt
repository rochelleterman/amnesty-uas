 India: attempted killings / fear for safety: Mian Abdul Qayoom, Parvez Imroz | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 22 April 1995 two unidentified men opened fire on Mian Abdul Qayoom, the President of the Jammu and Kashmir Bar Association, leaving him seriously injured. No investigation has been ordered into this incident. On 14 April another human rights activist, Parvez Imroz, Secretary of Srinagar Branch of the People's Union for Civil Liberties, was shot and injured by unidentified gunmen. Although the government reportedly have blamed the attack on militants, local people believe the unidentified gunmen are agents of the government. There is grave concern for the safety of other human rights activists, lawyers and journalists in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of these incidents."
