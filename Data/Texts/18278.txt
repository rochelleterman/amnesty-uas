 Muhammad Jamal 'Ali, 'Abd al-Qadir Muhammad Muqtar, Faqay Haji Cusman, Sali Id Farah Yacqub, Muhammad Nur Muhammad, Muhammad Abu 'Abd al-Qadir Ade, 'Abd al-'Aziz Muhammad Isse (Somali nationals): Two Saudi Arabian officials, the Interior Minister and the Ambassador to London, have made statements in response to Amnesty International's concerns about the death penalty. Neither though have provided any clarification as to why prisoners facing the death penalty are denied the right to be defended by a lawyer or why confessions, even when obtained under torture, are apparently accepted by the courts as evidence. The ambassador also failed to provide clarification regarding the seven Somali nationals named above, who have reportedly been sentenced to death for crimes they allegedly did not commit."
