 Nineteen men, aged between 16 and 22, have been           detained without charge since they were arrested by       members of the Crime Management   Unit (CMU). Some of the men have reportedly been denied   access to lawyers       and/or families. They have reportedly   all been          ill-treated. Amnesty International is concerned  for      their safety."
