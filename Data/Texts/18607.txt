 Syria: Further information on Fear of torture / incommunicado detention/ prisoners of conscience
 | Amnesty International 
 A further three young men have been arrested, apparently for involvement in pro-democracy activities. Maher Ibrahim, Ayham Saqr and 'Alam Fakhour have been held incommunicado since 23 February, when they were arrested by Air Force Intelligence officers at a house in a suburb of Damascus. The three are reported to be associates of 'Ali Nizar 'Ali and Husam 'Ali Mulhim, who were arrested on 26 January, and Tarek Ghorani, arrested on 20 February. All six are apparently held at the Air Force Intelligence Branch near Damascus. Amnesty International believes they are at serious risk of torture and other ill-treatment.
