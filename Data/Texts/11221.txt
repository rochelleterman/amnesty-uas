 India: Further information on Fear for safety: Civilians in Jammu and Kashmir | Amnesty International 
 AI continues to fear for the safety of civilians in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. On 23 May, the day of elections in Anantnag and  Baramulla districts, there were widespread reports that security forces had forced people out of their houses to vote and threatened them with physical violence. Several peaceful demonstrations were held in opposition to the elections. In Baramulla the demonstration was broken up by police and security forces who used tear gas and batons and fired over the heads of the demonstrators.
