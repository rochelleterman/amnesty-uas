 Kamal Khalil, a married father of two has not been seen since he left his home in Giza, on 19 February at around 11 am. He is believed to be held in incommunicado detention by State Security Intelligence (SSI) forces and is at risk of torture or ill-treatment. There are serious concerns for his health, as the stitches from a recent hernia operation were only removed six days ago and he is on medication.
