 Maldives: Medical concern/Legal concern/Prisoner of conscience: Jennifer Latheef | Amnesty International 
 Opposition political activist Jennifer Latheef was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment on 18 October, convicted of ""terrorism"" for joining a protest in September 2003 against deaths in prison and political repression. Immediately after sentencing, she was taken away in a speedboat, and her whereabouts are now unknown. She is suffering from irregular blood pressure and influenza, and without treatment her health could deteriorate further. Amnesty International considers her imprisonment to be politically motivated, and believes Jennifer Latheef is a prisoner of conscience, jailed solely for exercising her right to peaceful protest.
