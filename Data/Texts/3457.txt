 Democratic Republic of Congo: Torture / fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Bertin Lukanda, human rights activist, Diomba Ramazani, NGO worker: There is grave concern for the safety of Bertin Lukanda, currently held in a military camp, after reports that his colleague, Diomba Ramazani, who was detained with him on 6 August, has been transferred to Kindu General Hospital in a critical condition after suffering severe beatings at the military camp. Bertin Lukanda is the President of the Maniema branch of the Conseil regional des organisations non-gouvernmentales (CRONG). It is alleged that the soldiers accused CRONG of spying for a United Nations Commission of Inquiry into allegations of massacres in eastern DRC, and of having links with the main opposition party. Bertin Lukanda is also the head of information for a local independent human rights group, Haki Za Binadamu (HZB).
