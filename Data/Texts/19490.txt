 Halifa Sallah was arrested on 8 March at his home in Serrekunda, a suburb of the capital Banjul, and taken to Serrekunda police station by five plain clothed policemen. He is believed to have been arrested for his articles criticising the use of witch-doctors by the Gambian government. Amnesty International is concerned that he is at risk of being tortured or ill treated and being the victim of an unfair trial."
