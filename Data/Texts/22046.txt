 Khadijeh Moghaddam and Mahboubeh Karami have both been released on bail.  They and 10 others had been arrested on 26 March 2009 as they prepared to make Iranian New Year visits to the families of detained activists, including students and trade unionists. All 12 are now free on bail: no date is known to have been set for their trial, but they are at risk of being imprisoned solely for the peaceful exercise of their rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly."
