 Those named above were detained in the village of Huseyinkent on 12 July 1994. Soldiers arrived in the village on the evening of 12 July, searching for weapons allegedly hidden there (none were found). The people they detained, who include two 16-year-old and two 18-year-old girls, were reportedly paraded in front of the villagers, beaten and verbally abused before being taken away. Nebile Takab and other members of the Tabak family were previously detained in December 1993. AI fears that they may be being interrogated under torture in incommunicado detention at the Genddarmerie Headquarters in Igdir."
