 USA: Fear of forcible return to torture or ill-treatment: An unknown number of GuantÃ¡namo detainees | Amnesty International 
 The US Department of Defense may be seeking to transfer scores of detainees from the US naval base in Guantænamo Bay in Cuba to custody in other countries. While Amnesty International has been calling for, and would welcome, releases of detainees from the base, it is concerned to ensure that no detainee is forcibly returned to a situation where he would face human rights abuses.
