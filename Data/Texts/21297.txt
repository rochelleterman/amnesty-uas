 The two Egyptian nationals Abd al-Akher Hammad and Muhi   al-Din Ahmad Â‘Abd al-Mun'im, and their families, have     been given refugee status in Germany.
It had been feared that they would be forcibly returned   to Egypt, when their asylum applications were rejected in January 2000. This decision was reversed by the Federal   Office  following attempts by the German                  authorities to remove them from the country.
