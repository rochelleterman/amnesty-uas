 Trinidad and Tobago: Politically motivated attack on journalist - Professor Selwyn Cudjoe | Amnesty International 
 Two men have forced their way into the house of outspoken government critic Professor Selwyn Cudjoe, assaulting his sister and firing shots. The men made no attempt to rob   the house, and Amnesty International believes the attack  may have been politically motivated, intended to          intimidate or harm Professor Cudjoe.
