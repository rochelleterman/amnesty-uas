 Iraq: Fear for safety / fear of extrajudicial killing: 88 Palestinian refugees, including 42 children

 | Amnesty International 
 Eighty-eight Palestinian refugees, including 42 children, have been stranded near the Iraqi/Jordanian border since 19 March. They have fled the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, where many of the group had lived for decades, following an increase in killings and ""disappearances"" of Palestinians living there. Jordan has denied the group entry to Jordanian territory, in violation of its obligations under international law.
