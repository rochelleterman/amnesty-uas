 NA 
 Ali al-Marri – who has been held in indefinite US military detention as a so-called “enemy combatant” for more than five and a half years – has been charged for trial in federal court and President Barack Obama has ordered his transfer from military to civilian custody. The US administration has asked the US Supreme Court to dismiss Ali al-Marri’s habeas corpus case as moot. The Court is due to consider the question of dismissal on 6 March 2009, and is expected to make a decision on the same day or shortly thereafter."
