 Niger: Abolish the death penalty in Niger | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 No executions have been carried out in Niger since 1976.  Despite the fact that the prime minister declared in      August 2002 that he was against the death penalty all of  the criminal codes adopted since then have maintained the death penalty. Moreover, Amnesty International learnt     that the Niamey Criminal court sentenced Yahaya Moussa    Diarra to death in his absence for murder and night       robbery by forcible entry on the 23rd February 2004.
