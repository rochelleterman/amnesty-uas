 Djibouti: Further information on unfair trial / prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 On 6 October 1999, Moussa Ahmed Idriss was found guilty   of a new charge of violently resisting arrest. Nineteen   of his relatives and supporters were found guilty of the  same charge and also imprisoned. Amnesty International is concerned that they did not receive a fair trial. An      appeal date of 20 November has now been set for Ali       Meidal Wais and Daher Ahmed Farah. Both men were found    guilty at a summary trial on 2 September 1999.
