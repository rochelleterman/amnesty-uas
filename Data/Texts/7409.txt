 Mexico: Fear for safety / possible extrajudicial execution: PRD members and supporters in Cuadrilla Nueva, Guerrero state: Jesus Nuriostegui Gaona | Amnesty International 
 AI is concerned for the safety of members and supporters of the opposition PRD, Democratic Revolution Party, in Cuadrilla Nueva, municipality of Cutzamala de Pinzon. Tension and fear in the community have grown since the recent killing of the above, a 50-year-old peasant activist and PRD member, in the latest attack against those whose names are said to appear on a ""death list"". It is feared that more people named on the list, allegedly compiled by a local ""cacique"" (rancher), may be targeted.
