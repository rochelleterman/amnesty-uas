 Rwanda: Torture / fear for safety / medical concern: Zilpa Mukabarinda (f) | Amnesty International 
 There are grave fears for the safety of Zilpa Mukabarinda, a 25-year-old primary school teacher, who was detained by five armed men in military uniform on 23 March 1997 at her parents' house in Bwakira, Kibuye. Her father was prevented from accompanying them and was threatened with death when he inquired about the reason for her arrest. She was taken to a forest nearby and reportedly violently assaulted and raped. She is currently believed to be in detention in Kivumu commune, and is reportedly not receiving medical care for her injuries.
