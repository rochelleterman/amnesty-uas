 Syria: Further information on fear of torture/incommunicado detention/Prisoners of conscience and new concern: Unfair trial | Amnesty International 
 Mahmoud 'Issa was re-arrested on 23 October 2006, one month after being released from detention, where he had been held for four months in connection with his signing of the ""Beirut-Damascus Declaration"", a document signed by hundreds of Syrian and Lebanese nationals, calling upon their two governments to normalise relations by exchanging ambassadors and defining their shared borders. He was reportedly arrested by members of the security forces who said they were from the Criminal Security department. They now deny holding him and his whereabouts are unknown.
