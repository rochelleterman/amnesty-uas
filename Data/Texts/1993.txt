They included Ernest Allen, Adeline Koroma, Roy Stevens and Harry T T Williams . The identities of the other released detainees is not yet known. In a statement issued on 10 July Lieutenant Karefa Kargbo, Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stated that the remaining 156 detainees are alleged to have been involved with rebel forces, although none of those held appeared to have been captured during fighting, He also claimed that only 1 detainee had died in Pademba Road Prison since 1992.
