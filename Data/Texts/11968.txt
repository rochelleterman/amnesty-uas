 On 8 December 1994 journalist Chan Dara was shot dead in Kompong Cham Province. Two days before he was killed, he had informed his newspaper, Koh Santepheap, that he had received warnings from military police in Kompong Cham to stop his investigations into military involvement in the timber trade. Chan Dara also had contacts with Preap Norm Sar newspaper, which has published a series of articles on the illegal involvement of provincial military officials in the timber and rubber trades. AI is calling for the killing of Chan Dara to be investigated thoroughly. AI is also concerned for the safety of journalists at the Preap Norm Sar newspaper."
