 Sudan: Further Information on Imminent executions/Imminent Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment. | Amnesty International 
 Mohamed Ibrahim Abdallah and Fadul Adam Abdelrahman were not executed as stated in the previous update. Amnesty International has received new information indicating that death sentences were carried out on only three of the five men accused of armed robbery in 1998. The men were sentenced to cross amputation and death by hanging following an unfair trial at a court in Darfur, north-western Sudan on 18 March 1999. Mohamed Ibrahim Abdallah and Fadul Adam Abdelrahman are both still being held in Kober Prison, in the capital Khartoum. Their cases have been referred back to the constitutional court, and are apparently being appealed on technical grounds.
