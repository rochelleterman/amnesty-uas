 Israel and the Occupied Territories: Fear for Safety -    Civilians | Amnesty International 
 As the crisis in Israel and the Occupied Territories      deepens, Amnesty International renews its appeals to the  Israeli authorities to end the use of excessive force by  the Israeli security forces, which has resulted in        unlawful killings of Palestinians. Both Israeli settlers  and armed Palestinian groups have fired on civilian       targets.
