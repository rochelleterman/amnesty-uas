 Both the above-named, Bangladeshi nationals, were sentenced to death on 27 March 1991 for the murder of a Bangladeshi labourer in 1988. The sentence is believed to have been upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeal. The only hope of clemency now rests with the president. AI is concerned that the two men may soon be executed. "
