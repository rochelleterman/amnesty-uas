 Belarus: Death penalty / fear of imminent execution : Igor Lyashkevich | Amnesty International 
 Igor Lyashkevich was sentenced to death almost a year ago for allegedly being amongst a group of men who murdered a policeman.  Given the time that has elapsed since he was sentenced, Amnesty International fears that Igor Lyashkevich is at risk of imminent execution. As information regarding the death penalty is classified as a state secret in Belarus, it is unlikely that the existence or progress of any appeal on his behalf would be made public.
