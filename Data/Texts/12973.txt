 There are serious fears for the safety of three brothers arrested recently by the paramilitary Rangers in Karachi. Family members have not been able to establish their whereabouts and fear that the three could be tortured or killed in custody. The three men belonged to the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) until about 1991 but are not now members of any political party."
