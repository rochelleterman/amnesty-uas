 Iran: Prisoner of conscience/ flogging: Delaram Ali (f) 
 | Amnesty International 
 Delaram Ali, aged 24, has been told to present herself to court in order to start serving a prison sentence. She has been    told that if she does not attend court by 10 November     2007, she will be arrested. There is also a risk that she will be flogged. If she is detained, Amnesty              International would consider her to be a prisoner of      conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of  her right to freedom of expression and association for    her activities promoting women's rights in Iran.
