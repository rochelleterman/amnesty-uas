 UA 284/94 - Turkey: medical concern / fear of torture: Fahrettin Inal | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 17 July 1994 police took Fahrettin Inal from Diyarbakir State Hospital where he was being treated for severe injuries sustained when he had leapt from the fifth floor of a building in an attempt to escape from police who were pursuing him. He had previously been detained in October 1992 when he was tortured and threatened with death. There is concern that he may face further torture in police custody."
