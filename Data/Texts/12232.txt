 Malaysia: Arbitrary and incommunicado detention/fear of ill-treatment/prisoners of conscience	 | Amnesty International 
 At least 50 people, among them four leading members of    the opposition Parti Keadilan Nasional - National Justice  Party - have been arrested in connection with a 15 April  demonstration, and a magistrate has remanded them in      custody for further questioning. Amnesty International    fears they are at risk of serious ill-treatment in        detention, and is concerned at this seemingly arbitrary   decision to hold them for further questioning. The names of those arrested include: Tian Chua, Roslan Kassim, Mohd Ezam Mohd Nor, N. Gopalankrishnan, Abdul Malek Hussain    and  Mohd Hafiz Hashim.
