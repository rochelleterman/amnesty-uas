 Thailand: Fear for safety: Angkhana Neelaphaijit (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is gravely concerned for the safety of Angkhana Neelaphaijit, a leading human rights defender in Southern Thailand and wife of disappeared human rights lawyer Somchai Neelaphaijit. She is currently under a witness protection programme, but fears she may be in greater danger as her protection will next month be transferred to the police authorities."
