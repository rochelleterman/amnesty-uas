 Iran: Fear for safety/ Medical concern/ Incommunicado detention: Ahmad Batebi (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Former student activist Ahmad Batebi, aged 28, was reportedly re-arrested on 27 July and taken to an undisclosed place of detention, believed to be Evin Prison in Tehran. He is reportedly being denied access to his family and his lawyer, and is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. He is already in poor health after being tortured and ill-treated during his previous period in detention, and has begun a hunger strike in protest at his re-arrest. He may not be receiving the medical treatment he needs.
