 Kaphwiti Banda, a businessman, was arrested on 21 April 1993 at the airport in Lilongwe, on his return from exile in Zambia. He is an official of the opposition United Democratic Front (UDF), which is officially recognized to campaign in the referendum on the one-party system, scheduled for 14 June 1993. He is reportedly being held incommunicado in Maula prison in Lilongwe where conditions are harsh and political prisoners have been ill-treated in the past. He has not been charged and no reason has been given for his arrest. "
