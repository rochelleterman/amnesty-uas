 The 16 people named above, all members or suspected members of the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) have ""disappeared"" in military custody. There are seriouls fears for their safety. Region Five, or Ogaden, in eastern Ethiopia, inhabited mainly by ethnic Somalis, has been a virtually closed military zone for several months. Reports of more arrests being carried out there have heightened fears about violations occurring there."
