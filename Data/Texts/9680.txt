 USA (Louisiana): Death penalty / Legal concern, Lawrence  Jacobs (m), black, aged 24	

 | Amnesty International 
 The Parish of Jefferson, in the State of Louisiana, is intending to seek a death sentence against Lawrence Jacobs, or to use the threat of the death penalty to coerce him into accepting a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Lawrence Jacobs was 16 years old when he arrested and charged with first degree murder. International law, recognized by almost every government in the world, prohibits the use of the death penalty or life imprisonment without the possibility of release against those who were under 18 at the time of the crime.
