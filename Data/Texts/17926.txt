 Jordan: Death penalty: Mustafa 'Abd al-Mustafa | Amnesty International 
 On 3 March 1998 a Jordanian criminal court sentenced Mustafa ?Abd al-Mustafa to death, after he was convicted of robbing and killing Haygar ?Ali in February 1996. Mustafa ?Abd al-Mustafa was initially sentenced to life imprisonment on 16 March 1997. However, the Court of Cassation reviewed the case and returned the case to the lower court, ordering a harsher penalty to be imposed. The Court of Cassation and King Hussein bin Talal must now ratify the death sentence before it can be carried out.
