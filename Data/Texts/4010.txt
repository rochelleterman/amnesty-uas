 The body of Jean Alves da Cunha, a 13-year-old street child, was found on 13 November 1992, dumped on a hill in the city of Vitoria. He had been shot twice in the head; a forensic specialist has affirmed that he believes it was a professional killing. Jean Alves da Cunha was a leader in the Movimento Nacional de Meninos e Meninas da Rua and was preparing to attend the movement's Third National Congress from 19-22 November. On 11 October he and five other street children were detained by justice officials attached to the Juvenile Court; they were questioned and released. Later that evening the officials returned and detained Jean Alves da Cunha. He was never seen alive again. He had expressed fears for his safety because of allegations he had made against the police.
