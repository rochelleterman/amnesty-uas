 New information indicates that four soldiers, not six, from the 22nd Battalion were involved in the killing of three villagers and the wounding of three others in Ban teay. Three soldiers have been arrested and charged, and the fourth has been charged but is still at large. Families of those killed and wounded have reportedly received compensation. The villagers were given permission to hold a demonstration about the killings, but apparently were afraid to carry it out because local officials had asked questions over who had proposed it and police officials had made inquiries about how information about the killings had become widely known outside the province."
