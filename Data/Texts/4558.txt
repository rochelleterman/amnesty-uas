 Colombia: Fear for safety: Human Rights Defenders | Amnesty International 
 The killing of Dr. Eduardo Uma?a Mendoza, one of Colombia's most prominent human rights lawyers has heightened fears for the safety of all human rights defenders in the country. In recent years they have faced increasing harassment and intimidation and over the last year several have been killed. The UN has urged the Colombian government to safeguard the lives of human rights workers but they have continually failed to take effective action.
