 USA (Florida): Legal concern, Lionel Tate, black, aged 14. | Amnesty International 
 Lionel Tate recently began a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, for a crime committed in 1999 when he was 12 years old. His sentence violates international law. His lawyers have filed a clemency petition to the Governor of Florida, and Amnesty International is calling for Lionel Tate's sentence to be commuted and his treatment brought into line with international standards.
