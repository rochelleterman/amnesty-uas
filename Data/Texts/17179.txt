 Iran: Further information on Fear of torture or ill-treatment/ incommunicado detention/ possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Most of the hundreds of employees of the state-owned United Bus Company of Tehran (Sherkat-e Vahed), who were arrested after a 24 January call for a strike from their trade union, have been released. At least eight men are still in custody at Evin prison, in Tehran. Amnesty International considers them prisoners of conscience, detained solely for their peaceful trade union activities.
