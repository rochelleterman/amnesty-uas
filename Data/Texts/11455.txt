 Indonesia: death penalty: Tham Tuck Yin, aka A Tijai | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Tham Tuck Yin was sentenced to death in Central Jakarta District Court for drug trafficking. He was also fined Rp 50 million. His lawyers are arguing that this contravenes Article 67 of the Penal Conde, which stipulates that a death sentence cannot be imposed along with fines or any other sentence. Tham has indicated that he will appeal."
