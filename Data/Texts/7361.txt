 UA 390/94 - Mexico: torture / fear for safety: Demetrio Hernandez Rojas, Felix Fernandez Estrada, Diego Garcia Bautista, Cruz Martinez Hernandez, Eladio Torres Flores, Jaime Laguna Berber | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Demetrio Hernandez Rojas was reportedly tortured following his detention on 19 October in Ciudad Netzahualcoyotl, state of Mexico, by members of the security forces. It is believed that Felix Fernandez Estrada, detained on 20 October, may also have been tortured. Both men took part in the National Democratic Convention (CND) in August 1994, and remain in detention charged in connection with an explosion in Mexico City in January 1994. Arrest warrants have also reportedly been issued against Jaime Laguna Berber, Diego Garcia Bautista, Cruz Martinez Hernandez and Eladio Torres Flores, all participants in the CND. Diego Garcia Bautista has reportedly received threatening phone calls. There are fears that if these people are arrested, they may also be subject to torture and ill-treatment."
