 EXTRA 76/92 - Hong Kong: fear of forcible return (refoulement): Liu Yijun, Lin Lin | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI fears that Liu Yijun and Lin Lin, two women from the People's Republic of China, are under imminent threat of forcible return from Hong Kong to China. AI believes that they would be at grave risk of imprisonment as prisoners of conscience if returned. Liu Yijun, aged 29, is a university graduate, former journalist and editor, and poet. She claims that articles written by her which were critical of Chinese policy were published by a Hainan magazine during and shortly after the pro-democracy movement. Lin Lin, a 24-year-old computer programmer, gave shelter to Liu Yijun; she says that fear of being accused of ""harbouring fugitives"" led her to follow Liu Yijun when the latter decided to leave for Hong Kong.
