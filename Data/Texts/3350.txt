 Zaire: Fear of torture / possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Kabande, local chief, Rugazura, local chief, Pasteur Muzizi, Pasteur Bugunzu, Pasteur Semutobo: The five elderly men named above, arrested by members of the Zairian Armed Forces on 20 August 1996, are being held incommunicado in a military camp at Luberizi. Amnesty International is concerned that they may be prisoners of conscience, held solely because of their ethnic origin. The organization is also seriously concerned for their safety, given that torture and beatings in custody are routine in Zaire, particularly in military camps.
