 UA 249/94 - Nigeria: extrajudicial executions / fear for safety: Members of the Ogoni ethnic group | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Since 21 May 1994 more than 50 members of the Ogoni ethnic group are reported to have been extrajudicially executed and over 180 others wounded during attacks by the security forces on Ogoni villages in Rivers State. The victims include women and children. The presence of security forces in Ogoniland was intensified following the murder of four leading members of the Ogoni community by a group of youths. In their supposed search for those responsible, the security forces have arbitrarily arrested hundreds of members of the Ogoni community."
