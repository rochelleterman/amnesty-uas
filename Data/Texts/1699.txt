"Nigeria: Fear of ill-treatment 
 Nigeria: Fear of ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Nine women and 16 children, arrested in Kaduna, northern Nigeria, could suffer ill-treatment in detention because of their relationship to four political prisoners. They include Zeenah Ibrahim, wife of Ibrahim Al-Zakzaky and the wife of Hamid Danlami. Both men are leading members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Conditions of detention are generally so harsh in Nigeria that they amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Police are reported to have shot dead as many as 10 people in daily protests about the women's arrest.
