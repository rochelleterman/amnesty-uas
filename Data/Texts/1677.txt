 AI has learned that the four supporters of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, arrested on 4 August 1995, have been unconditionally released.  They had been held without charge.  It is not clear whether the women supporters of MOSOP, who were reported to have been arrested at around the same time, have also been released, but it seems likely that they too were released uncharged after a short period."
