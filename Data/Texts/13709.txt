 The 149 Lao Hmong refugees detained at Nong Khai Immigration Detention Center (IDC) began a hunger-strike at midday on 16 August in protest at their continued detention in appalling conditions. There are grave concerns for their welfare, particularly as more than half of them are children and some are already suffering from health problems made worse by the conditions at the detention centre and the fact that they have been detained for a prolonged period.
