 Workers and trade union leaders at the Lunafil S.A. textile factory in Amatitlan are reported to have been subjected to repeated death threats and other acts of intimidation since May 1994, when a groups of 49 of them began a protest outside the factory against what they claim to be its illegal and unjustified closure. It has been suggested that some of the private security guards hired by Lunafil during previous disputes may have been responsible for some of the recent incidents. No official investigation has been opened."
