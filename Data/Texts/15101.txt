 Four prisoners have been killed by gendarmes forcing entry into a ward at Buca Prison near Izmir in Western Turkey. AI fears further casualties as security forces prepare to enter other wards where an estimated two hundred prisoners are barricaded in. Meanwhile lawyers, members of the prisoners' families and representatives of medical and human rights organizations have been severely beaten by security forces while seeking details outside the local state hospital. Sixty have been detained and are believed to be held at Izmir police Headquarters. The gendarme action followed protests about the brutal prison regime by hunger-striking prisoners."
