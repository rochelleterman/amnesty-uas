 Fahad Salem al-Shehhi, a civil society activist detained on 10 April, was released on 17 April. However, three bloggers have been detained in the ongoing clampdown in the UAE. They join fellow blogger Ahmad Mansoor and economist Nasser bin Ghaith, detained on 8 and 10 April, respectively, and are in custody in Abu Dhabi. Amnesty International believes that these five detainees are prisoners of conscience."
