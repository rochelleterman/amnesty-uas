 Mexico: Further information on fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 In a further police raid on 6 February, all of the        students still on strike at the National Autonomous       University campus were arrested. On 8 February more than  500 were released. Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of all those  still detained, particularly as  a number are thought to have been denied access to their  families, lawyers of their choice and medical attention.
