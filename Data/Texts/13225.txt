 Philippines: Further information on imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Dante Piandong, Jesus Morallos and Archie Bulan face      imminent execution on 8 July 1999 when their reprieve     runs out. They were sentenced to death in November 1994   for the killing of a police officer during an attempted   robbery. There is concern that allegations of torture,    which may have affected the fairness of the trial, have   not been investigated.
