 Muhterem Ayato was unlawfully detained in police custody for two and a half months until around 29 April, when he was formally arrested, charged and committed to prison. He is currently in prison in Elazig. No details are available as to the charges or his treatment in custody. Salih Kara has also been transferred to Elazig prison, but no information is available about his treatment or charges brought against him.
