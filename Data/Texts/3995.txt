 NA 
 Jorge Antonio Careli, an employee of the state-owned Oswaldo Cruz medical foundation, was last seen on 10 August in the shanty town, favela, of Varguinha, on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Witnesses reportedly saw him being detained and beaten by police officers from the Anti Kidnapping Division (DAS) of the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police. The police deny his detention. The following day people from the favela allege that DAS police returned and intimidated witnesses to prevent them identifying the officers involved. "
