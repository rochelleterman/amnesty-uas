 Guatemala: Fear for Safety | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Suseuent to government statements condoning attacks on    human rights activists, Amnesty International is very concerned for the safety of the members of these organizations.
Members of the Guatemalan Forensic          Anthropology  Foundation, which is involved in the   exhumations of     mass clandestine graves of villagers   killed during the  civil conflict, were  attacked by  heavily armed          individuals stealing their pick-up trucks.
Following this, there was a break-in at the central       office of the Students' Association of the Autonomous     State University of Guatemala (USAC). The Asociaci√≥n de   Estudiantes Universitarios (AEU), which has traditionally been outspoken on  political and human rights issues and  its leaders have    been frequent targets of human rights abuses in the past."
