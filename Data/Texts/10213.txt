 Venezuela: fear of torture: Isabelino Bustamante, aged 67, and 19 others, names unknown | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned for the safety of Isabelino Bustamante and 19 others arrested on 14 July 1995 by the Policia Tecnica Judicial in Guasdualito, Apure State. Members of Isabelino Bustamante's family allege that he has been tortured in detention; he reportedly has a fractured nose and swollen hands, results of torture. These arrests were made reportedly in connection with the recent kidnapping of the mayor of Guasdualito, allegedly by Colombian ELN guerrillas. AI is calling for those in detention either to be charged  and brought before a competent court or to be released. AI is also calling for the allegations of torture to be investigated."
