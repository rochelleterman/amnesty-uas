 Several thousand Palestinians are stranded in northern    Egypt, unable to return to their homes in the Gaza Strip. The Rafah Crossing between Gaza and Egypt has been closed by the Israeli authorities since 9 June. Hundreds of      those stranded are camped out close to the border         crossing. Many have inadequate food, water and shelter    although they are in the desert at the hottest time of    the year. Their health and safety remain at risk while    they continue to be prevented from crossing the border    and returning home.
