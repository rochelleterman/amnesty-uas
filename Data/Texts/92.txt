 | Amnesty International 
 Raul Danda was conditionally released on the afternoon of 27 October. He had been arbitrarily arrested on 29 September by members of the Provincial Criminal Investigative Police, on his arrival at the airport in Angola's Cabinda province. He appeared to be a prisoner of conscience, arrested solely for his peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression and his membership of a banned human rights organization Mpalabanda - Associaà®o CÁvica de Cabinda (Mpalabanda - Civic Association of Cabinda).
