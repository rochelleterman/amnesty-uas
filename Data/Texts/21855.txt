 At least 36 people who had been held in a detention facility in Nakhl, northern Sinai, were among some 100 Eritrean asylum-seekers forcibly returned from Egypt between 23 December 2008 and 18 January 2009. Their fate is not known, but a large number of asylum-seekers forcibly returned to Eritrea in June 2008 are still in custody, where they are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Dozens of others still held in the Nakhl detention centre are at risk of deportation to Eritrea. "
