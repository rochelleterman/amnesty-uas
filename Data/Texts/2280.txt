 Siza Rani, chairperson of the Sharpeville town branch of the ANC, is still being harassed and kept under surveillance by members of the South African Police based in the Vaal Triangle and by unidentified men apparently operating with the acquiescence of the police. He is still in hiding. No progress appears to have been made in the investigations into charges made by Siza Rani against the police almost a year ago. "
