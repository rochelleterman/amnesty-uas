 Mexico: Human rights lawyer threatened: Gustavo de la Rosa Hickerson | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Human rights lawyer Gustavo de la Rosa Hickerson has been threatened with death because of his work in charge of the Ciudad Ju√°rez office of the Chihuahua State Human Rights Commission (CEDH), in northern Mexico. The president of the CEDH has ordered Gustavo de la Rosa to stop receiving complaints from victims of alleged abuses by the military and refused to support his request for protection. The CEDH has apparently also told him that he will lose his job if he does not return to work by 6 October 2009."
