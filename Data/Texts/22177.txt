 Mojtaba Hussein was released on bail on 2 June 2008. Two others, now known to be a married couple, who had been arrested in April in the city of Amol, have also been released. Another Christian convert, Mohsen Namvar, was arrested on 31 May. Like Arash and Mahmoud Matin, who are still in custody, he appears to have been detained solely because of his religious beliefs, which would make him a prisoner of conscience."
