 USA: Legal concern, Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 23 March, in what could be a litmus test for the future direction of US counter-terrorism detention policy, the US Justice Department is due to file its legal arguments in the Supreme Court in the case of Ali al-Marri, the only person being held on the US mainland as an “enemy combatant”. In addition, President Barack Obama last month ordered his administration to review Ali al-Marri’s detention in order to identify what the government’s lawful options are in his case, including trial or release."
