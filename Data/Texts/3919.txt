 NA 
 Arnaldo Delcidio Ferreira, President of the Rural workers trade union of Eldorado do Carajas, near Maraba, south Para state, was killed on 2 May 1993 by a gunman who entered his home and shot him while he was sleeping. His 17-year-old son witnessed the shooting. Arnaldo Ferreira had been receiving death threats for some time in connection with his trade union and environmental activities. In a previous attempt on his life in April 1985, a gunman wounded him and killed Sister Adelaide Molinari, a nun, who was talking to him at the time. Judicial investigations into her death have been repeatedly stalled. "
