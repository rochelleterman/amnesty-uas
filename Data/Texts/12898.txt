 Pakistan: Further information on death threats/fear for safety/possible death penalty/prisoner of conscience. New concern: Death penalty | Amnesty International 
 Younis Masih, a Pakistani Christian, was sentenced to death for blasphemy  on 30 May. He is appealing against   his sentence. He has been    attacked twice by inmates at Kot Lakhpat prison in Lahore, and remains at risk of      further      attack at the hands of prisoners and guards. Amnesty      International considers him to be a prisoner of           conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of  the right to freedom of expression. His      lawyer, Parvez    Aslam Choudhry, has survived an         apparent attempt on his   life and has been threatened as a result of  his involvement in the case.
