 Iran: Azerbaijanis arrested in lake protests | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Around 70 Iranian Azerbaijanis were reportedly arrested on 2 April 2011 during peaceful demonstrations in Tabriz, and about 20 others in Oromieh, north-western Iran. The protesters were calling for Lake Oromieh to be saved, as it is at risk of drying out due to dam building. Most have been released but the whereabouts of at least five protesters remain unknown."
