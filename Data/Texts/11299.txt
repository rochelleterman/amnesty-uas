 India: Fear for safety for the population of Jammu and    Kashmir	

 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned that there   may be an escalation of violence in the north Indian      state of Jammu and Kashmir. At least 100 civilians  were  killed there in the past 24 hours. Of major  concern is   that the Jammu and Kashmir government have                consistently failed to properly investigate the unlawful  deaths of large numbers of people or to      prosecute    the perpetrators .
