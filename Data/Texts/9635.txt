 EXTRA 77/94 - USA (Texas): death penalty: Jesse Jacobs | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Jesse Jacobs, white, is due to be executed on 4 January 1995. He was convicted of murder in 1987 for the shooting of the estranged wife of his sister's boyfriend. His sister was subsequently tried for the same crime and convicted of involuntary manslaughter. According to Jacobs's attorneys, the state accepted at that trial that it was she who had shot the victim and that Jacobs had not anticipated the shooting. Jacobs was convicted on the basis of a pre-trial confession, which he subsequently recanted. However, the jury accepted the state's version of the confession. AI is concerned by claims that Jesse Jacobs may not be guilty of capital murder."
