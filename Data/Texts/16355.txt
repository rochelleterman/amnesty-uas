 Some 150 civilians, the majority Muslims, have reportedly been detained and many ill-treated in an improvised prison camp outside the town of Velika Kladusa by supporters of a local separatist leader, Fikret Abdic. On 26 July Tadeusz Mazowiecki, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the former Yugoslavia, stated at a press conference that they were being held in very poor conditions and that many had been beaten. Male detainees were being made to carry out forced labour, and that some of the detainees are reportedly seriously ill or disabled and are not receiving adequate medical care."
