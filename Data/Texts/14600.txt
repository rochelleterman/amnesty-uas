 Amnesty International is concerned that the 37 people named above, who were arrested at the Ekin Arts Centre in Ankara on 18 April 1993, may be being interrogated under torture at the Anti-Terror Branch of Ankara Police Headquarters. Several of the detainees named above have previously been detained. Members of the families of Eylem Kaya, Ozgur Baris Ozcelik and Tulay Gencay applied to the Ankara State Security Prosecutor for access to their relatives, but were refused on the grounds that the detainees were being interrogated for suspected membership of an armed organization.
