 Rachid Medjahed (alias Khaled Abou Mouaad), an ex-member of a town council representing the now banned Front Islamique du Salut (FIS): The family of Rachid Medjahed was informed on 3 April 1997 that he had died in detention on 26 February 1997. They have not been told the circumstances of his death, nor have they been able to recover his body for burial. There is concern that he may have been extrajudicially executed in detention.
