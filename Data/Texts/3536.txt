 Eritrea: Fear of torture/arbitrary detention | Amnesty International 
 Three trade union leaders, Tewelde Gebremedhin (m), Minassie Andezion (m), and Habtom Weldemichael (m), are now known to have been arrested on or soon after 30 March, in the capital, Asmara. They are held incommunicado, which puts them at greater risk of torture or ill-treatment. Amnesty International believes they may be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for their legitimate trade union activities.
