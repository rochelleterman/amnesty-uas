 Israel: Detention as hostages -Mustafa al-Dirani and      Shaykh 혩Abd al-Karim 혩Ubayd

 | Amnesty International 
 The Israeli government has adopted a draft law   entitled ""The Imprisonment of Combatants not Entitled to  Prisoner of War Status"". If passed, this would undermine basic     principles of international humanitarian  law and enable  the continued detention of Shaykh ?Abd     al-Karim       ?Ubayd and Mustafa al-Dirani as hostages. The    bill     passed its first reading in the Knesset (the Israeli      parliament) on 21 June 2000.
