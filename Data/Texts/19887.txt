 Colombia: Fear for safety/ Death threats | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 6 March 2008, a coalition of human rights organizations, trade unions, indigenous groups and other organizations participated in a series of demonstrations in Colombia and around the world. The demonstrations condemned human rights violations committed by the Colombian security forces and army-backed paramilitary groups. Those who belong to organizations believed to have been involved in the demonstration have been threatened or killed, both before and since the march."
