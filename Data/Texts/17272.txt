 | Amnesty International 
 Delara Darabi's death sentence, handed down at a retrial in June 2006, was reportedly upheld by Branch 33 of the Supreme Court on 16 January 2007. Her lawyer reportedly lodged an appeal at the beginning of March. Concerns have been raised about her physical and mental health in       detention. Delara Darabi, now aged 20, therefore          continues to face the death penalty for a murder which    took place when she was 17 years old, and which she       denies committing.
