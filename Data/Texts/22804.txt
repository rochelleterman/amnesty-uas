 Kurdish political activists Sa’dun Sheikhu and Mohammad Sai’d ‘Omar were arrested on 25 October 2008 and have since been held incommunicado. They are in serious danger of torture. Amnesty International believes they may be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and association."
