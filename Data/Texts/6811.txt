 The six people named above ""disappeared"" on 25 March 1994 while on their way to a meeting of the Organisation Populaire 17 Septembre (OP-17). Jean-Salomon Erase and Arsene Coicou, both known supporters of President Aristide, were reportedly abducted by members of the political group Front Revolutionnaire pour l'Avancement et le Progres Haitien (FRAPH), a front group for the attaches. The other four ""disappeared"" in unknown circumstances."
