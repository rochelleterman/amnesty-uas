 USA: Urge Illinois Governor to sign abolition bill | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Illinois legislature has passed a bill to abolish the death penalty in the state. This historic bill now goes to the state governor who can sign it into law or veto it. Governor Pat Quinn has said he will look at the bill “very carefully”. He has a maximum of 60 days to act on it. Appeals to the Governor at this stage could help convince him to sign the bill into law."
