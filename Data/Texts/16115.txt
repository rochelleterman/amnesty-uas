 UA 74/93 - Turkmenistan: death penalty: Yury Yurevich Ayriyev | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Yury Yurevich Ayriyev was sentenced to death for murder in November 1992 by the regional court of Balkansky region sitting in Nebit Dag. An appeal to the Supreme Court has apparently been unsuccessful. The only remaining avenue of appeal is a petition for clemency, which he submitted to the President on 11 February 1993. "
