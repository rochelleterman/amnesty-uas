 Syria: Fear of torture/incommunicado detention/possible   prisoner of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Sheikh Muhammad Ma'shuq al-Khiznawi, an imam or Islamic religious leader, is reportedly being detained incommunicado at an unknown location and may be tortured or ill-treated in detention. The Syrian authorities have reportedly denied that they are holding him. If his detention is confirmed, Amnesty International will consider him to be a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for expressing his beliefs.
