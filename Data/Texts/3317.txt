 Democratic Republic of Congo: Torture and ill-treatment / cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions of detention | Amnesty International 
 Four men, Muhombo Mirimo, aged 15, Munihire Mirimo, Muhima Kamayole, and Floribert Mirimo, and an unknown number of others are being held in incommunicado detention in a metal freight container at Ndosho, near the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The four men are reportedly in a poor state of health, as a result of their prolonged confinement in deplorable conditions inside the container. Amnesty International believes that they and other detainees held with them may also be subjected to ill-treatment or torture. Weteshe Mahindule, who had been incarcerated in the container since February, died on 17 April.
