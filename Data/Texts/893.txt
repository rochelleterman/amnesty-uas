 Ethiopia: Further information on Cruel, inhuman and egrading treatment / possible prisoner of conscience / reported death threats: Dr Taye Woldemasayat | Amnesty International 
 Dr Taye Woldesemayat appeared in court on 18 September 1998 and was no longer being held in hand-chains. AI welcomes this development. However, he continues to be held in a special so-called ""darkness cell"", which lacks natural daylight but has constant electric light, and is still denied confidential access to his lawyer. The allegations of torture to extract confessions from Dr Taye's co-defendants have not been investigated.
