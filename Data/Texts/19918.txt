 Members of the Afro-descendant community of Caracolí, in the Curvaradó region of Chocó Department, were not served with a threatened eviction notice on 18 June 2009, thanks to a Colombian constitutional court ruling and pressure from the international community. Local police were preparing to serve the notice until the Colombian Constitutional Court ordered the immediate suspension of the eviction notice and called for the protection of the community."
