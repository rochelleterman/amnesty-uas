 China: Imminent execution / death penalty / ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Ji Xiaowei, Zhan Xiaozhou and Yu Jianqing: Ji Xiaowei, a Hong Kong citizen, is reportedly due to be executed on 18 July 1997. He has appealed against the verdict on the grounds that the evidence presented at the trial was based solely on a confession obtained from him under torture and on his co-defendants' statements. It is not known if their statements were also obtained by duress. Though little is known about his two co-defendants, it is also feared that Zhan Xiaozhou may be executed at the same time.
