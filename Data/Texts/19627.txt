 Thirteen people have been detained for five weeks reportedly in Dirbat by the Sudan Liberation Army/Abdel Wahed (SLA/A-W), an armed opposition group in Darfur. They are apparently being detained on the orders of Abdel Wahed Mohammed Nur, the leader of the SLA/A-W. Their exact location is not known and Amnesty International fears that they are at risk of being tortured or ill-treated or unlawfully killed."
