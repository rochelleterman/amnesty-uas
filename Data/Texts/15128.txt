 AI is seriously concerned for the safety of the above, a 45-year-old active member of the People's Democracy Party, who was last seen in Diyarbakir on 24 June 1996 and has since been missing. His family believe that he has been detained by members of the security forces and fear for his life. Their inquiries with the Police Headquarters and the prosecutor's office have failed to establish his whereabouts. He was previously detained three times in 1994.
