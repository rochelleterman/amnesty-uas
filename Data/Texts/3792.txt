 Three military policemen have been charged and await trial for the killing of seven children and one youth as they slept rough outside the Candelaria church on 23 July 1993. The trial is expected to take place in March 1994. No charges have yet been brought against eight others, including police, suspected of involvement in the killings. There remains concern for some 58 named child witnesses to the massacre. Ten have been offered temporary protection at a Witnesses Safe House. Another 16 are reportedly at a children's institution. However the majority remain on the streets where they are at risk. Several have received death and bomb threats from members of the military police."
