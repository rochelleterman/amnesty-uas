 Colombia: Further information on  Fear for Safety/Death threats/possible ""disappearance"" | Amnesty International 
 Army-backed paramilitaries raided more areas of Barrancabermeja on the night of 21-22 March, abducting a 14 year-old boy. They were able to proceed unhindered despite a heavy military presence, and although the authorities had been warned repeatedly about the incursions. Since 16 March, paramilitaries have set up checkpoints in the north-east Comuna 6 district of the city, apparently searching for ?guerrilla collaborators and human rights defenders?
