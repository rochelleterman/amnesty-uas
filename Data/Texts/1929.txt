 Rwanda: Further information on death penalty / unfair trial: Leonidas Ndikumwami | Amnesty International 
 The case of Leonidas Ndikumwami, who was sentenced to death after a grossly unfair trial on 20 January 1997, was heard by the Court of Appeal in Kigali on 22 May 1997. On 31 May it announced that his appeal was admissible on the grounds that his right to legal defence had been violated. The court has ordered further investigations into the charges against him. There is still concern, however, that he remains under sentence of death.
