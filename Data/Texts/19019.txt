 Tunisia: Fear of torture / Possible arrests/ Possible prisoners   of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Four men Hamma Hammami, Abdeljabbar Madouri, Samir Taamallah and Ammar Amroussianamed , who have been on the run for four years because of their membership of an outlawed political party. Have announced that they intend to come out of hiding. Political opponents or alleged political opponents of the Tunisian government are routinely arrested and tortured, and the authorities may attempt to force these men to confess to illegal activities carried out during their time on the run. If they are arrested, Amnesty International will consider them prisoners of conscience.
