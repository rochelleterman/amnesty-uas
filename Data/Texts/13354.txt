 The above named men,believed to be Malaysian nationals, are scheduled to be hanged on 28 April 1995. They were sentenced to death in May 1989 for murder. Their appeals against the sentences were rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal in April 1991. Jabar Kadermastan's lawyer has been fighting the case on the basis that it would be unconstitutional and unlawful to carry out the execution because of the length of time elapsed since conviction."
