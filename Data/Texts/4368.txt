 There is concern at the apparent extrajudicial execution of Jose Severo Rubiano Cruz, allegedly by members of the army on 27 December 1993 in the village of Payacal, municipality of La Mesa, Cundinamarca department. According to reports he was killed when soldiers surrounded his house and opened fire without warning. His father, Severo Rubiano Cruz, managed to escape, and witnessed the soldiers destroying the house. He denounced these events to the authorities, but so far no action has apparently been taken to identify those responsible and bring them to justice."
