 Recent death threats against Teresa Mosquera, a member of the Civic Human Rights Committee of Meta, have raised serious fears for her safety. The threats were contained in a letter signed by the paramilitary group Death to Communists. It was received shortly after the creation of a Commission to investigate the human rights situation in the department of Meta and has heightened concern for all members of the Civic Human Rights Committee of Meta, many of whom have been forced to leave the department of Meta."
