 Following intense international pressure, the above named men, arrested in Bata on 31 August, were released on 20 September 1993. Francisco Engono Micue had been severely tortured and sustained serious injuries to his arms, feet, back and one eye. Jose Ramon Obama was also ill-treated. Father Jose Luis Engono, Francisco Engono Micue's son, who had gone into hiding to evade arrest, had reemerged after the government gave written assurances that he would not be arrested or harassed.
