 Venezuela: Further information on torture / fear for safety: Wilfredo Alvarado Baldaggio, community activist | Amnesty International 
 There are renewed fears concerning the safety of community activist Wilfredo Alvarado Baldaggio after he was threatened by a member of the National Guard on or around 11 February 1998. A complaint against members of the National Guard responsible for the arrest and torture of Wilfredo Alvarado has been opened.  The case is currently at the pre-investigative phase. It is thought the threats are an attempt to deter him from pursuing the case.
