 Burundi: Further information on fear of ill-treatment / torture / possible prisoners of conscience / health concern | Amnesty International 
 Reverend Eliezer Ntunzwenimana; and new names: Reverend Faustin Nkurinziza, member of the Union of Baptist Churches in Burundi, Reverend Jean-Pierre Mandende: On 27 May 1997 Reverend Eliezer Ntunzwenimana was unconditionally released. During his detention at the Brigade speciale de recherche (BSR) in Bujumbura he had been severely beaten. There is now concern for the safety of two other protestant ministers, who were arrested in April and have reportedly been tortured in detention, accused of involvement in a series of mine explosions in Bujumbura.
