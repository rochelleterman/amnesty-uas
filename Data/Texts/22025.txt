 Iran: Further information: Football journalist still at risk: Abdollah Sadoughi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Football journalist and member of the Azerbaijani minority in Iran, Abdollah Sadoughi, was released on 11 March, after seven weeks of detention in Tabriz Prison, north-west Iran. In the next 10 days, he is likely to be given a trial date, and the trial itself could follow soon after. If convicted and imprisoned, Amnesty International fears that he would be a prisoner of conscience."
