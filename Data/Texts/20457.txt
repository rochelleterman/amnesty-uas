 Peru: Medical action: Public Ministry rejects assistance of forensic experts in death investigations | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Peruvian Public Ministry has rejected the advice of two forensic anthropologists, attached to the Equipo Argentino de Antropologia Forense (EAAF: Argentine Team of Forensic Anthropology) who joined an Amnesty International delegation to carry out investigations into four unmarked graves discovered on 8 July 1993, near Cienaguilla on the outskirts of Lima. The graves were believed to contain the remains of nine students and a lecturer from La Cantuta University, who were abducted by members of the army on 18 July 1992. Contrary to advice, local authorities carried out inadequate excavations of the sites, which almost certainly have destroyed or damaged important evidence."
