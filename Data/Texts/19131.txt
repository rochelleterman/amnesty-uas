 Hamma Hammami, a prisoner of conscience imprisoned since his arrest on 14 February 1994, began a hunger-strike in protest at his imprisonment and was transferred from Sousse prison to 9 Avril Prison, Tunis. During his hunger-strike from 1 to 10 May 1994 he was held incommunicado in solitary confinement, was kept permanently in chains, and was denied access to toilet facilities. He was also refused sugar to take with his water."
