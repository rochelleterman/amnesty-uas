 There are fears for the safety of Ali Mahmud Hassanein, a prominent lawyer in his late 50s, who was arrested in Khartoum on 6 June 1994. His current whereabouts are unknown and he may be at risk of torture while in detention. It is believed he may be a prisoner of conscience arrested solely in relation to his professional activities as a lawyer."
