 USA (Guantanamo): Further information on medical action: Haitian asylum seekers | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 16 March 1993 Federal District Judge Sterling Johnson Jr issued an interim ruling ordering the US administration to improve conditions for asylum-seekers with AIDS at Guantanamo, or evacuate them to the mainland. Following this ruling over 30 asylum-seekers were allowed to go to the USA. In a further ruling on 8 June Judge Johnson found that the US government policy was unconstitutional and violated the Haitians' right to due process. He ruled that the Haitians should be released and the camp at Guantanamo closed. On 9 June, the US administration announced it would not appeal the ruling. All of the asylum-seekers have now arrived on the mainland."
