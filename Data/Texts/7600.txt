 | Amnesty International 
 Prisoner of conscience Magdalena Garcia Duræn has won a third federal injunction (amparo) against her detention. However, Amnesty International is concerned that rather than ordering her immediate release, the authorities will seek to avoid releasing her as they have done on previous occasions in order to continue her unfair and unfounded prosecution.
