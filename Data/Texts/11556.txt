 Pedro Fatima Tilman, Miguel and Is (believed to be Isaac), three of the East Timorese named above, have been brought to trial at Dili District Court. Two others are due to be tried on 21 or 22 June. Of those arrested and detained in East Timor, some are believed to have now been released. According to reports, none of the three have been accompanied by legal counsel, either during interrogation or during their trial. The exact charges laid against them are unknown. They were arrested for taking part in a peaceful pro-independence demonstration in front of the Mahkota Hotel in Dili, during a visit to East Timor by foreign journalists."
