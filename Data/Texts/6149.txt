 On 23 March 1995, Arnoldo Xi, an indigenous peasant and member of the indigenous organization CONIC, was shot and abducted. There are grave fears for his safety. Arnoldo Xi is the Vice-President of the Comite de Pro-Mejoramiento de Tixila in Purila. His companion escaped unhurt and reported the abduction to CONIC. The attack took place in the context of a land dispute between members of the Tixila community and a local landowner."
