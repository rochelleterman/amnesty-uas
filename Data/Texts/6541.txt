 Amnesty International has learned that the attack on 31 August on Rene Cabrera Estrada, a member of STECSA, who later died on 29 September, does not appear to have been politically motivated. No further information is available concerning the other three men listed above who died during the police action at the Hacienda San Juan del Horizonte."
