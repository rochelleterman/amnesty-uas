 Egypt: Prisoner of conscience: Dr Ahmad al-Ahwany | Amnesty International 
 There is concern at reports that Dr Ahmad al-Ahwany, a professor of Nuclear Energy at Cairo University, was arrested on 24 April 1997. It is believed that he was arrested because he was in possession of a bulletin critical of a new agricultural land law. Amnesty International is calling for his immediate and unconditional release as a prisoner of conscience.
