"Mexico: Fear for safety 
 Mexico: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 At least 40 people were arrested on 16 July in Oaxaca during violent clashes between demonstrators and state police during an Oaxaca festival, the Guelaguetza. Local human rights organizations and the detainees' families claim they are being held incommunicado, and fear for their safety. Two human rights defenders (Jes£s Alfredo L¢pez Garcça (m) and Cesær Grijalva (m)) were beaten by police at the festival and had to receive hospital treatment for their injuries. They now fear reprisals for having filed a complaint with the authorities against the police.
