 NA 
 Iranian Kurdish human rights defender Farhad Haji Mirza’i is being held in Tehran's Evin Prison, and is believed to have been mentally and physically tortured. Reports suggest that he may have been sentenced to death. Amnesty International believes that he may be a prisoner of conscience, held solely on account of his peaceful activism in defence of human rights. "
