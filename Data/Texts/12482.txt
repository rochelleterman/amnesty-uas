 UA 314/93 - Nepal: torture / possible extrajudicial executions: Kiran Shrestha, Shankar Rokka, Lochan Nepal, Kapildev Singh, Bijaya Mahato | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern about the torture in police custody of three students, Kiran Shrestha, Shankar Rokka and Lochan Nepal, and the possible extrajudicial killings of Kapildev Singh and Bijaya Mahato outside Barahathawa police station, Sarlahi District, on 23 August 1993. In protest against alleged corruption in the distribution of relief materials to flood victims, three students from a local youth club apprehended one of two local businessmen allegedly involved, and took him to the police station. There they were themselves arrested and severely beaten. One student, Kiran Shrestha required hospital treatment. Police then opened fire without warning on a crowd gathered outside, which had begun to throw stones, killing Kapildev Singh and Bijaya Mahato and wounding three others "
