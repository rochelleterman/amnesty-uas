 NA 
 Fernando de Leon, the Secretary of the Executive Board of the Asociacion Guatemalteca de Juristas (AGJ), Guatemalan Association of Jurists, has recently been persecuted and threatened in Guatemala City. At the beginning of July he noticed he was under surveillance from two men. On 11 July, a trade unionist, Walter Manuel Najera Molina, was reportedly abducted for several hours. The next day he visited Fernando de Leon, and told him he had been questioned about several people, including Fernando de Leon. On 20 July he again saw the two men who had been watching him. In the following days a firm of undertakers called twice at his office stating that they had been informed that a burial service for him was needed. "
