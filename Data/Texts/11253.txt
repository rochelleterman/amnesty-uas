 UA 194/93 - India: ""disappearance"" in Jammu and Kashmir: Nazir Ahmed Misri | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Nazir Ahmed Misri, a 26-year-old school teacher, was taken into custody on 7 June 1993 by members of the Border Security Forces in the area of Zero Bridge, Srinagar, during a military operation. He has not been since his arrest, although others arrested during the operation have subsequently been released. His family do not know of his whereabouts and there is grave concern that he is at risk of torture and even death while being kept in unacknowledged detention. "
