 Iran: Incommunicado detention / fear of torture/ possible prisoner of conscience: Mehdi Babaei Ajabshir (known as Oxtay) (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Mehdi Babaei Ajabshir (known as Oxtay), aged 31, a prominent Azerbaijani activist, was arrested on 11 July. He is detained incommunicado at an undisclosed location, believed to be either Tabriz prison or a Ministry of Intelligence detention facility in Tabriz, northwestern Iran, where he is at risk of torture. He may be detained on account of his peaceful activities on behalf of the rights of the Azeri-Turkish minority, in which case Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience.
