 There is grave concern for the safety of Everardo Salgado Roman, an active member of the Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD), who was abducted on 11 August 1997 in the town of Iguala, Guerrero State. He has not been seen since, and there are fears that he has been arbitrarily detained by members of the security forces.
