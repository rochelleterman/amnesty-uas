 At least 19 conscientious objectors are reported to be facing trial in Cyprus in September and October 1994. All are Jehovah's Witnesses and as such are opposed to performing any form of military service. If convicted, they face up to one year's imprisonment. AI will consider them prisoners of conscience if they are imprisoned."
