 Uganda: Fear for safety / fear of detention without charge or trial | Amnesty International 
 There are deep concerns for the safety of Asgha Pishdar whose whereabouts are unknown but who is apparently in illegal detention following his arrest on 15 August 1998.  Amnesty International therefore fears he is at risk of ill-treatment or of being deported.
