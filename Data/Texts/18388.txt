 Saudi Arabia: Further information on Death Penalty, Deni Magomedzayev, Idris Arsayev | Amnesty International 
 The two men named above have reportedly been charged in connection with the hijacking of a plane in March and their case has been transferred to a Shari'a (Islamic) court. A trial date has yet to be set. Amnesty International is concerned that they are at risk of an unfair trial and that if convicted, face the death penalty.
