 Up to 20 ""guilty delinquents and mischievous"" people are to be executed in Tehran over the next two weeks, according to a report in the newspaper Norouz on 16 May. At least 10 people, including one Ahmad Dolatyari, have reportedly been executed since then, and Amnesty International fears that a wave of executions is underway. Ali Reza was reportedly sentenced to 74 lashes on 21 May, and has apparently been given 20 days to appeal; and seventeen-year-old Ramin was sentenced to 20 lashes for possession of heroin, on 17 May. The sentence was reduced to 15 lashes because he suffers from a thyroid condition, and will be carried out in three years' time.
