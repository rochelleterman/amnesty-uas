 NA 
 On 18 January 2008, a 15 year-old girl, Adriana Sarmiento Enriquez, went missing in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua state. She is feared to have been abducted. Her life is at risk, as hundreds of women and girls have been murdered in Ciudad Juarez over the last 15 years. On a number of occasions, the authorities have failed to respond rapidly to reports of women and young girls going missing."
