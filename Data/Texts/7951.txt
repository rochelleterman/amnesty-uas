 On 2 April 1994, a patrol of about 20 soldiers reportedly attacked the town of Chavin de Pariarca, throwing hand grenades at the church and at the home and offices of district governor Ulises Espinoza Sanchez. They also reportedly machine-gunned the empty car of Father Fidelius. The attack followed complaints of theiving and looting by army patrols against the local population. The governor's father and two brothers were reportedly briefly detained and the governor himself reportedly brutally beaten when he enquired about them."
