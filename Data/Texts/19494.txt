 Gambia: Further information: Activists jailed for distributing t-shirts | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Four activists have been convicted over the distribution of Coalition for Change – The Gambia (CCG) t-shirts calling for an ‘End to Dictatorship Now’ in The Gambia. Amnesty International considers Dr Amadou Scattred Janneh, Michael C. Ucheh Thomas, Modou Keita and Ebrima Jallow to be prisoners of conscience, and their imprisonment as violations of their freedom of expression, assembly and association. The organisation is calling for their immediate and unconditional release."
