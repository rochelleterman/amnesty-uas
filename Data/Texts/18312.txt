 International news agencies have reported that two men, Oswaldo Magdangal and Renato Posedio, are to be beheaded on 25 December 1992. Both appear to have been arrested because of their active role in the Christian community in Saudi Arabia. AI is not aware of the official charges laid against them but there are allegations that the two were charged with blasphemy. Oswaldo Magdangal is a Filipino and an active member of the Pentecostal Assembly in Mursallat, Riyadh; AI considers him a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for the peaceful exercise of his religious beliefs. AI has no further information about Renato Posedio. "
