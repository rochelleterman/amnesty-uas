 Peru: Further information on torture / fear for safety / possible death in custody: Leonor La Rosa Bustamante | Amnesty International 
 Leonor La Rosa Bustamente (f), an army intelligence agent: There is concern at reports that there was an apparent attempt to abduct Leonor La Rosa Bustamante from the Military Hospital where she is recovering from the effects of torture she suffered at the hands of members of the Army Intelligence Service (SIE). The people who made this attempt claimed to be attached to the Supreme Council of Military Justice (CSJM). She refused to accompany them, and according to the reports, the CSJM has subsequently issued a statement that there had been no order issued to bring her before an inquiry. There remains grave concern for her safety.
