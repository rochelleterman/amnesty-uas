 There is concern for the safety of the above-named men who were detained during joint operations by the Mobile Rural Patrol Unit (UMOPAR) and security forces on 15 and 17 November 1995 in El Chapare region while dispersing peasant demonstrations in the area. Two children were killed during the operations and scores of trade union leaders, peasants and other civilians were arrested. The first three are held in Chimore barracks, but the whereabouts of Teodocio Romero remain unknown. Reports indicate that most of those detained have now been released, but many have alleged that they were beaten and ill-treated in police custody."
