 Juana Calfunao Paillalef, a community leader from the Mapuche ethnic group, and her family have suffered a campaign of intimidation, including the apparent murder of her uncle and an arson attack on her home. All this is apparently connected to her community's dispute with local landowners over land ownership. The authorities have apparently taken no action to protect them, and Amnesty International believes their lives are in danger.
