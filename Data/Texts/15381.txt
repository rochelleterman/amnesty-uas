 There are grave fears for the safety of several Kurdish villagers from near Silopi, Sirnak province, who are reported to have ""disappeared"" after being detained by security forces in October and November 1995. The bodies of Kamil Bektas, headman of Yenikoy (Xerabresk) village and Suleyman Acar from Baskoy (Tilkabin) village were found on 6 December 1995 near Silopi. A third body has been found headless and showing signs of torture and it is feared to be that of Kerevan Irmez."
