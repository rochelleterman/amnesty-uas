 UA 406/93 - Bahrain: fear of forcible exile: Dr 'Abd al-'Aziz Rashid al-Rashid | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 'Abd al-'Aziz Rashid al-Rashid, a medical doctor, has been the subject of repeated measures to forcibly exile him from Bahrain. A Bahraini national, he is in danger of being expelled for the fourth time in the space of one week. In the latest move, he was expelled to Syria on 18 November. However he has no valid travel documents, and the Syrian authorities are expected to return him to Bahrain, where the authorities are likely to expel him yet again."
