 Cambodia: Further information: Group 78 evicted in Cambodia | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Low-income families living in the area known as Group 78, in the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, have been forcibly evicted after three years of government harassment and intimidation. Around 60 Group 78 families had no choice but to accept inadequate compensation and dismantle their own homes rather than have them destroyed by force. The authorities threatened to forcibly evict them on 17 July 2009, and they received information that up to 700 security forces had been mobilized for the eviction. "
