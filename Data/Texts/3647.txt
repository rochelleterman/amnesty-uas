 Bahamas: Forcible Return of Asylum Seekers | Amnesty International 
 An estimated 130 Haitian nationals, some of whom are understood to be seeking political asylum, are at risk of being forcibly returned to Haiti, without any examination of their asylum claims. Amnesty international has longstanding concerns about human rights violations in Haiti, and fears their lives may be in danger if they are returned.
