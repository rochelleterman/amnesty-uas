 Jordan: Further information on death penalty / torture: Montasser Rajab Abu-Zaid | Amnesty International 
 On 2 March 1997 the Court of Cassation ratified the death sentence on Montasser Rajab Abu-Zaid. There is concern that Montasser Rajab Abu-Zaid has alleged that he and his wife, who was not a suspect, were beaten and deprived of sleep while held in preventive detention in the police station in Salt, during which time he made a confession. This confession reportedly formed the basis for his conviction. The court did not an order an investigation into these allegations.
