 Indonesia: Fear for safety/death threat, Taha Mohammad Alhamid, Aristoteles Masoka | Amnesty International 
 Taha Alhamid, a leading pro-independence activist in the Indonesian province of Papua, received an anonymous telephone death threat on 28 November. Amnesty International is seriously concerned for his safety, particularly following the abduction and unlawful killing of another leading pro-independence activist, Theys Eluay, less than three weeks ago. Theys Eluay's driver, Aristoteles Masoka, is still missing, and there are concerns for his safety.
