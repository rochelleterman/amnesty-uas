 Pakistani national Rafat Usmani was arrested and detained on 28 May 2008 and says that he was tortured the same day. The authorities have since denied holding him in custody, leading to concern that he has been subjected to enforced disappearance. He is in grave danger of further torture or other ill-treatment."
