 Rwanda / Uganda: Forcible return/ fear of torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 The 10 men named (Francois Ruceba, Jackson Safari, Peter Kabagambe, Peter Bisamaza, Vedaste Lyarwema, Paul Rwangabo, Daniel Kazungu, Aloysius Badege, Asumani Rutigana, Ismail Salomo) were forcibly returned on 13 March from Uganda to Rwanda, on suspicion of involvement with an illegal armed group. Amnesty International fears that they are likely to face torture or ill-treatment, and an unfair trial, at the hands of the Rwandan authorities. Approximately 60 further individuals in Uganda facing similar accusations are also at imminent risk of forcible return to Rwanda.
