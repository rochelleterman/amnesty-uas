"United Arab Emirates: Fear of torture / possible prisoners of conscience 
 United Arab Emirates: Fear of torture / possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Jassim 'Issa al-Yassi, customs inspector, aged about 25, Ahmad 'Abdullah Makki, soldier, aged about 27, Yassir 'Abdullah Makki, municipal worker, aged about 25, brother of Ahmad 'Abdullah Makki: The above are being held in prolonged incommunicado detention in Dubai. They were arrested in June 1996, together with Ja'far Hassan Sahwan, a Bahraini national sought by the Bahraini government as a political suspect. Amnesty International is concerned that they may be prisoners of conscience, detained solely because of their relationship to Ja'far Hassan Sahwan, who was reportedly handed over to the authorities in Bahrain.
