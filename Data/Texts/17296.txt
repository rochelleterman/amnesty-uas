 Iran: Further information on Fear of imminent execution | Amnesty International 
  Qasem Salamat and Majed Alboghubaish were reportedly     executed on 14 February in a prison in Khuzestan province. The two men were reportedly convicted, together with eight others including Abdulreza Sanawati Zergani,   Abdul Husain Haribi, Husain Maramazi and Husain Asakreh,  of being mohareb (at enmity with God) on account of their alleged involvement in bomb attacks in 2005 in Ahvaz      city, Khuzestan province. Early reports stated that       Abdulreza Sanawati Zergani had also been executed:        however, further reports suggest that his execution was   postponed and that teacher Risan Sawari was executed      instead.
