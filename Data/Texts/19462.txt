 Equatorial Guinea: Four at risk of torture in Equatorial Guinea | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Four Equatorial Guinean refugees are believed to have been abducted from Benin by security forces from Equatorial Guinea, and returned to their native country. The authorities there have not confirmed the whereabouts of the four men or even whether they are holding them, leading to fears that they are at risk of enforced disappearance. They are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment.  "
