 Guatemala: Fear for safety/death threats | Amnesty International 
 Roly Escobar Ochoa, a member of the National Coordination of Marginalised Communities and Areas of Guatemala (Coordinadora Nacional de Pobladores y µreas Marginadas de Guatemala, CONAPAMG) has been threatened. This appears to be an attempt to dissuade the organisation from demanding justice for the murder of CONAPMG member Carmen Sagastume. Amnesty International believes that the lives of Roly Escobar and his colleagues may be in danger.
