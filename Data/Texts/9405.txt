 | Amnesty International 
 On 18 May 2000, the New Hampshire Senate voted by 14      votes to 10 to abolish the death penalty. The bill will   now pass to the Governor, who can sign it into law, allow it to pass into law without her signature or veto it. She has five days in which to make her decision. If she takes no action, the bill will become law automatically.
