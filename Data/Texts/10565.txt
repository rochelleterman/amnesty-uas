 Myanmar: Fear of torture or other ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Six people, including prominent activists Htay Kywe, Mie Mie (also known as Thin Thin Aye) and Aung Thu, were detained in the early hours of 13 October 2007 in the city of Yangon as part of a continuing crackdown by the military authorities. The three are believed to be the last high-profile members of the 1988 Generation Students group who were still at large. There is no information on where they are being detained. Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the safety of all six people, who are at grave risk of torture and ill-treatment.
