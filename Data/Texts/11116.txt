 NA 
 Jaswinder Kaur and her father, Darshan Singh, have not been seen since they were taken on separate occasions from their home in Punjab by members of the Ropar branch of the Criminal Investigation Agency. On 26 February 1995, CIA officials, looking for Jaswinder Kaur's husband, raided the family home and took her away. They reportedly beat her. They returned on 6 march and took Darshan Singh. Police subsequently confiscated the house, making Jaswinder Kaur's mother and two children homeless. Two habeas corpus petitions have been filed. There are grave fears for their safety."
