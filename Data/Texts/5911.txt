 UA 385/93 - El Salvador: apparent political killings / fear for safety: Medardo Brizuela Hernandez, Justa Victoria Orellana Cortez, Heleno Hernan Castro | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Medardo Brizuela Hernandez and Justa Victoria Orellana Cortez, both members of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), were shot dead in Canton San Lucas on 27 October 1993. Heleno Hernan Castro was leader of the FMLN faction, People's Expression for Renewal, and was a member of the FMLN's National Council. On 30 October his body was found in a vehicle on a highway near Santa Cruz Porrillo, east of San Salvador. An autopsy revealed he had been shot several times. These killings come days after the murder of Francisco Veliz, a member of the FMLN's National Council and candidate for deputy in the March 1994 elections. There is now increased fear for the safety of members of the FMLN and other opposition parties in the run-up to the elections. "
