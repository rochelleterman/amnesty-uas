 Algeria: Prolonged secret detention/ Fear of  'disappearance'/  Fear of ill-treatment - Omar Toumi | Amnesty International 
 Omar Toumi was reportedly arrested in Algiers on 26 January, when he did not return from a hospital visit. His family presumes that he is being detained at El-Harrach prison, but has not received official notification of his whereabouts nor have they been able to see him. By law, Omar Toumi should have been brought before a court within twelve days, or released.
