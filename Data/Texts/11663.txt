 Amnesty International has received confirmation of the    names of 28 people detained at Sorong Police Resort       (Polres) in connection with the flag-raising              demonstration in Sorong on 22 August. It is unclear       whether the original figure of 36 arrested is inaccurate  or whether some detainees have since been released.
