 Kyrgyzstan: Further information on fear of forcible return/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Four refugees from Uzbekistan, Zhakhongir Maksudov (m); Odilzhon Rakhimov (m); Yakub Toshboev (m); Rasulzhon Pirmatov (m); who have been in detention in Kyrgyzstan since June 2005, are believed to be in imminent danger of being forcibly returned to Uzbekistan having exhausted all available legal procedures. Amnesty International is concerned that if returned to Uzbekistan, the men are at risk of serious human rights violations, including incommunicado detention, torture and other ill-treatment, a flagrantly unfair trial followed by either long prison sentences or even the death penalty.
