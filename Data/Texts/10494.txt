 The Embassy of the Union of Myanmar in Canberra, Australia, has written to the Australian Section of AI on the cases of Mohamed Ilyas and Fazal Ahmed. The letter says that Mohamed Ilyas was arrested while attempting to plant mines near Buthidaung Gold Course in Rakhine (Arakan) State. It goes on to say that his death in detention occurred during medical treatment for an acute gastro-intestinal disease and denies that it was due to torture or ill-treatment. Unofficial sources have said that Mohamed Ilyas was in good health at the time of arrest. The letter claims that Fazal Ahmed, arrested in connection with the alleged mine-planting, is in good health in detention. "
