 Colombia: Fear for Safety/Possible disappearance | Amnesty International 
 Army-backed paramilitaries have reportedly abducted a leading member of a teachers' union during a raid on a farming community.             Paramilitaries are         reportedly looking for five teachers   in the region whom they accuse of being guerrilla         collaborators, and Amnesty International fears that other teachers in the    region are in danger.
