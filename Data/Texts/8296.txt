 UA 311/92 - Peru: fear for physical safety: Anne-Marie Parodi, Martin Heiming, Heriberto Ocasio | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Anne-Marie Parodi, a French lawyer and Martin Heiming, a German lawyer, are members of a group calling themselves the Ad Hoc Legal Observation Delegation. They are in Lima with their translator, Heriberto Ocasio, ostensibly to observe and report on the trial of the leader of the ""Shining Path"" (PCP), Abimael Guzman. AI is concerned about reports indicating that they have been intimidated and particularly about reports that Heriberto Ocasio was physically attacked by unidentified assailants while accompanying the other two members of the delegation on 5 October 1992.
