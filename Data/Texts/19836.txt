 The community of Restinga is in imminent risk of forced eviction due to the construction of a highway in Recreio dos Bandeirantes, Rio de Janeiro. After months of threats, on 22 October 2010 at 9:00am council workers, accompanied by heavily armed civil and military police, began bulldozing a commercial district that has existed for over twenty years, destroying five shops."
