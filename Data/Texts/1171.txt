 Koigi wa Wamwere, Stefan Kariuki Muigai, John Njoroge Wamwere, Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki, Francis Ngigi Kabege and Wilfred Kinuthia Ngengi were all arrested in early November and charged on 10 November with attempted robbery with violence and being in possession of firearms without a certificate. There is concern that these charges may have been fabricated, and that their arrest appears to be part of a pattern of harassment and arrests of critics of the government, who are investigating the political violence in the Rift Valley and other parts of western Kenya. There is further concern that if convicted on these charges they would face the death sentence."
