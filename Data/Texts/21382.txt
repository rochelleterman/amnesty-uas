 Turkey: Shelters need government support | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 In 2005, a legal provision came into force in Turkey for municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants to open at least one shelter for survivors of domestic violence. According to this law, over 3,000 shelters should be opened around the country. To date, not a single municipality established a new shelter because of limited budgets and a lack of political will."
