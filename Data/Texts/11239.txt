 A habeas corpus petition concerning the ""disappearance"" of Jaswant Singh Khalra was filed by his wife in the Supreme Court in New Delhi on 12 September.  The Supreme Court reportedly summoned the state government to explain his ""disappearance"" but when police officials appeared before the court they denied that he was in police custody.  The Supreme Court has now set the next hearing for 28 September at which they have ordered the Punjab police to produce Jaswant Singh Khalra.  AI continues to fear for his safety."
