 Veysi Karagul, former president of the (now banned) pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) in Derik, has not been seen or heard of since he was detained by plainclothes police at his home in Mersin on 24 December 1994. Veysi Karagul was previously detained in November 1993 and held for five months. After his release in 1994 he left his home in Derik and settled in Mersin. The police reportedly brought him back to his home on 24 December, which they searched without finding anything. They allegedly beat his wife and daughter before taking him away again. There is grave concern for his safety."
