 EXTRA 81/94 - USA (Missouri): death penalty: Roosevelt Pollard | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Roosevelt Pollard, black, is scheduled to be executed in Missouri on 11 January 1995. He was sentenced to death for murder in 1986. Pollard's present attorneys claim that he is incompetent to be executed: he reportedly cannot understand the reason for his execution. Because of allegedly inadequate legal representation in the past, evidence of his psychological problems and unstable and abusive family life has not been adequately reviewed by any court."
