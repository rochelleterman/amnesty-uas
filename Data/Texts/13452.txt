 Sri Lanka: Fear for safety: Professor Ratnajeevan Hoole | Amnesty International 
 A group believed to be a front organisation for the armed opposition group Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam has threatened to kill an academic (Professor Ratnajeevan Hoole (m), aged 53) who has links to an anti-LTTE group. Amnesty International believes his life is in grave danger. People claiming to represent a group called the People's Uprising Force telephoned Professor Ratnajeevan Hoole's home, in the town of Peradeniya, several times on 11 March, warning that if he stepped onto the campus of Jaffna University, where he had just been appointed Vice Chancellor, he would return home ""headless in a box"".
