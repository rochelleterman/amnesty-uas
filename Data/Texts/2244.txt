 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Malose Lehobye, ANC branch chairperson in Mabopane, Bophuthatswana, following an attack in which he was injured by unidentified armed men on 18 May 1993 as he was returning home. When his wife opened the door to try and help him, shots were fired at her, but hit the door. She phoned the Bophuthatswana police for help, but despite her appeals and visits to the police station by concerned friends, the Mabopane police refused to send officers promptly to protect the family and investigate the incident. This attack occurred after suspicious incidents including anonymous phone calls to his home and close sureveillance of his movements. One of the vehicles used by the attackers is alleged to belong to the local security forces. "
