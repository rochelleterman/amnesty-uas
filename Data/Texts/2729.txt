 UA 150/93 - Sudan: fear of torture / legal concern: Gaafar Yasin Ahmad | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern that Dr Gaafar Yasin Ahmad, the owner of a small private pharmaceutical company, may be subjected to torture or ill-treatment, following his arrest in Khartoum in late April 1993. He is reported to be held in incommunicado detention, either at the security headquarters in Khartoum or at a secret detention centre known as a ""ghost house"". The authorities are not known to have provided any reasons for his arrest, but it is thought to have been for political reasons. "
