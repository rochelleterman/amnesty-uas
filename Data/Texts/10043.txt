 On 26 October 1999, the US Supreme Court ruled that it    would consider whether execution in Florida's electric    chair violates the US Constitution. The Court made its    ruling in the case of Anthony Bryan, but the decision     means that both he and Terry Sims now have an indefinite  stay of execution, and halts executions in Florida.
