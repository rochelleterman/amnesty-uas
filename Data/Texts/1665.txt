 Reports indicate that Dr Beko Ransome Kuti may have been brought before a Special Military Tribunal shortly after his arrest on 27 July 1995, secretly tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. AI considers him to be a prisoner of conscience and continues to call for his release. It appears that he may have been convicted in connection with the publication of information about the proccedings of the Spacial Military Tribunal which has unfairly tried and convicted 43 people in connection with an alleged coup attempt in March 1995. It is not clear of the others named above have been charged or tried."
