 Abduvali Mirzoyev, an Islamic religious leader, is feared to have ""disappeared"" since he was detained on 29 August 1995. Unofficial sources say he was detained apparently by officers of the National Security Service at the airport in Taskent as he was waiting to visit London. Despite inquiries there has been no news of him since then."
