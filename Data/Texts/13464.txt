 The above eight people have ""disappeared"" after being arrested by the army in Batticaloa District. There are fears they may be being held in unacknowledged incommunicado detention without access to their families or lawyers. They were variously arrested between January and June 1993 by army personnel from the Morokottenchenai, Kiran, Kommathurai and Rukam army camps. The local Peace Committee in Batticaloa town has appealed to the authorities on their behalf, but has received no information as to their whereabouts. "
