 NA 
 Miguel Angel Casillas, editorial director of local newspaper, Diario de los Altos, was threatened on 18 March by a man claiming to be an official in charge of the Zetas’ department (a notoriously criminal organization responsible for hundreds of murders). The threat was made because Miguel Angel Casillas and the newspaper he works for have given critical coverage to a dam development project in el Zapotillo, Los Altos region, Jalisco state."
