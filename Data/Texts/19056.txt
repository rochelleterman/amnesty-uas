 Tunisia: Further information on fear of torture / ill-treatment and new concern: fear of further possible arrests | Amnesty International 
 Qais Ouislati, Noureddine Benticha, Ali Jallouli, Lotfi Hammami, Taha Sassi, Sabri Ben Belgacem and new names: Jalal Bouraqui, Jalloul Ouislati, Chedli Hammami, all university students except Chedli Hammami: The three above-named people have been arrested and placed in secret detention in connection with the student strikes and meetings calling for better conditions that took place in Tunis and a number of other cities last week. All nine continue to be held in secret detention; all efforts by their families and lawyers to obtain information concerning their whereabouts and legal status have been in vain.  AI fears that they may all be at risk of torture or ill-treatment, a practice widely used against detainees during secret detention.There are also fears that a former prisoner of conscience and flatmate of Jalal Bouraoui is reported to be currently sought by police and that he too may be arrested.
