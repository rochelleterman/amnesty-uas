 On 30 June 1993 the district public prosecutor of Belgrade filed an indictment against Vuk and Danica Draskovic, who are at present in the Neurological Clinic in Belgrade. Vuk Draskovic has been charged with ""hindering an official in the performance of his duties"", and both Vuk and his wife Danica have been charged with ""taking part in a gathering which used violence"". He has requested that Vuk and Danica Draskovic remain detained pending trial. On 6 July the Supreme Court also ruled that they should remain in detention. Vuk Draskovic began a hunger strike on 1 July in protest at his continued detention, and on 2 July a 10 member forensic medical team, who examined them both in mid-June, declared that their health had seriously deteriorated, and advised that the two be released.
