 UA 217/94 - Uzbekistan: fear for safety: Khamidulla Nurmukhamedov and other members of the Erk (Freedom) Party | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A bomb exploded at the home of Khamidulla Nurmukhamedov, a leading member of the banned Erk (Freedom) party, on 27 May 1994. Nobody was hurt. The incident bears similarities to the bombing of the home of another opposition activist in 1992, where the involvement of government agents was suspect. AI fears that, in view of the clampdown on Erk since early March 1994, they may be further attacks against party members. AI is calling for a full investigation into the bombing and for the authorities immediately to stop harassment of Erk members."
