 Iraq: Former Iraqi officials face death penalty | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A former Minister of Interior and two former top officials under Saddam Hussein were sentenced to death on 29 November and could be executed within 30 days if their sentences are confirmed by the appeal court. Amnesty International has stressed that the death penalty is the ultimate denial of human rights and should never be used, whatever the gravity of the crime."
