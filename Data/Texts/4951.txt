 Lacides Bandera Ariza, who was feared ""disappeared"" after his arbitrary detention by soldiers of the Batallon de Magangue, was reportedly released in good health several days later, after interrogation. However, on 17 June two women, Julia Isabel Pacheco and Ledis Teresa Villalobos, ""disappeared"" from the same village of Puerto Rico. The military have again denied their detention."
