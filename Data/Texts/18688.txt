 Syria: Further information on Incommunicado Detention/ Fear of torture or ill-treatment/ Medical Concern: Sa'ad Noori Hussain al-Jiburi (m) | Amnesty International 
 The Syrian authorities have reportedly confirmed that Sa'ad Noori Hussain al-Jiburi, aged 62, is in their custody. Amnesty International has received information that he is being held at the Palestine Branch of Military Intelligence in Damascus, reportedly in a small cell with 25 other Iraqis. Amnesty International fears that all of them are at risk of torture and ill-treatment. In addition, Amnesty International continues to be concerned about Sa'ad Noori Hussain al-Jiburi's health as he suffered a stroke last year.
