 There is concern for the safety of 53 members of the Guarani-Kaiowa indigenous community following an illegal eviction from land they had occupied in Sucuriy, Maracaju municipality, Mato Grosso do Sul state by a group of 50 armed civilians. The armed men have reportedly made explicit threats of violence against the Guarani-Kaiowa, and it is believed that while the land dispute remains unresolved, the 14 Guarani-Kaiowa families are at risk of human rights abuses.
