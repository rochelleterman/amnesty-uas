 Bahrain: Possible extrajudicial execution / fear of further killings: Nidal Habib Ahmad al-Nashaba | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Nidal Habib Ahmad al-Nashaba, aged 18, was shot dead by security forces during protests in al-Duraz on 4 May 1995. The protests were staged to commemorate the 40th day after the killing of another youth, 'Abd al-Hamid 'Abdullah Qassem, aged 17, in al-Duraz on 25 March. This brings to 12 the number of civilians killed in separate incidents since December 1994 and there is deep concern about the continued use of live ammunition by the security forces to disperse demonstrators."
