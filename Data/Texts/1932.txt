 Deogratias Bizimana, Egide Gatanazi: The Court of Appeal in Kigali has confirmed the convictions and death sentences against the above men. It reportedly did not acknowledge that their trial had been unfair and denied that the defendants had been refused access to a defence lawyer. The defendants were not present at the appeal, nor were the lawyers who had acted on their behalf during the appeal procedure. The defendants had not been given advance notice of the date of the appeal hearing.
