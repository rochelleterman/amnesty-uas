 On 2 March the Seoul 12th Administrative Court issued a temporary injunction against the forcible deportation of Michel Catuira, President of the Seoul-Gyeonggi-Incheon Migrants’ Trade Union (MTU) in South Korea. However, the injunction will apply only until MTU’s appeal case against the cancellation of his visa status has been decided. Therefore, he remains at risk of deportation. "
