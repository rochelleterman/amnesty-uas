 NA 
 In addition to the 10 prisoners of conscience who began a hunger-strike on 14 February, at least 25 other political prisoners joined the hunger-strike on 21 February. They are said to be protesting against their continued detention after unfair trials before the Martial Law Court in May and June 1991 and before the State Security Court in 1992. There is growing concern for their welfare, after reports that 25 of them have been transferred to hospital in a weak condition."
