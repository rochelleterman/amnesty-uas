 Syria: Further information on: Fear of torture and ill-treatment/unlawful detention/incommunicado detention  -  Arwad Muhammad Â‘Izzat Al-Buchi (m), aged 45, engineer | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has recently learned that Syrian-born Canadian national Arwad Muhammad 'Izzat Al-Boushi (spelling corrected) received a grossly unfair trial in July 2003 at which he was apparently sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. He was reportedly tortured during the 12 months he was detained awaiting trial. Amnesty International believes he may be a prisoner of conscience, held solely for the non-violent expression of his political beliefs.
