 Burundi: Further information on death in detention/torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 The gendarmerie officer accused of beating Diomède Buyoya to death was released, apparently without charge, on 30   March, and is reported to have returned to work. Amnesty  International no longer considers Andr_ BAZIRINYAKAMWE,   Andr_ BIGIRIMANA, Pascal NYABENDA, Eliazard BANDYAMBONA   and Etienne BAYAMPUNDE to be at risk of torture or of     ""disappearance"". All were provisionally released after    paying a fine. L_vi Rukondo, Nestor Nikogaboma and        Can_sius Barakamfitiye continue to be held in Mpimba      central prison.
