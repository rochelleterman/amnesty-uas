 Colombia: death threats / fear for safety: Apraez family and witnesses in a ""disappearance"" case | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There are serious fear for the safety of members of the Apraez family, who have been receiving death threats during the course of penal investigations into the ""disappearance"" of Nancy Apraez and her baby, Carlo Alberto Apraez, in 1992. Witnesses in the case have also been threatened as the 11 agents of the DAS face legal action for their involvement in the ""disappearance"". She and her son were detained on 8 August 1992. Nancy Apraez has never been seen since; her baby son was found abandoned three months later and given for adoption under a false name. The family have established his whereabouts and identity and have initiated legal proceedings to regain custody."
