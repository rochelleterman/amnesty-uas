 Guatemala: Further information on extrajudicial execution: Mons. Juan Gerardi Condera | Amnesty International 
 Since his brutal murder in April 1998, the authorities have insisted that Bishop Juan Jos? Gerardi had been the victim of a common crime or a crime of passion. However, in a report made known last week, Acisclo Valladares, the person commissioned by the Guatemalan Catholic church to examine the investigation by the authorities into the murder of Bishop Gerardi, concluded that he is likely to have been extrajudicially executed and that the priest arrested for his murder has been wrongly accused.
