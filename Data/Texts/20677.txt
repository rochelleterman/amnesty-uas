 NA 
 Jeffrey Landrigan, a 50-year-old Native American man, is due to be executed in Arizona, USA, at 10am on 26 October 2010. Thirteen federal judges have argued that he should have had a hearing into his claim that he was inadequately represented at his 1990 trial. In 2007, the trial judge said that she would not have passed a death sentence if she had heard the mitigating evidence."
