 The death on 4 July 1995 of Shefki Latifi after allegedly being severely beaten in custody has greatly increased fears for the safety of other ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province as short-term arrests continue. He was reportedly arrested in the street by police officers in Podujevo and taken to the police station on the morning of 4 July. His friend, Ramadan Salihu, was also severely beaten at the police station. An investigating judge in the town of Prokuplje has reportedly being asked to issue an order for an autopsy. The number of arrests of ethnic Albaniana, particularly in Podujevo, has increased since 26 June, when and ethnic Albaninan police officer worker for the State Security Police of Serbia was shot dead."
