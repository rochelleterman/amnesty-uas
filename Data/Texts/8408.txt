 The hearing scheduled of 11 January 1993 in the cases of these two men has been postponed until 8 February 1993. Their lawyers anticipate a further delay, after 8 February, as their cases will depend on the decision on the constitutional motion on their cases which is still pending before the Court of Appeal."
