 Manuel Cepeda Vargas, Aida Abella and Alvaro Vasquez del Real, opposition leaders, have been receiving death threats. Since the beginning of October 1992, several national leaders of the left-wing opposition party Union Patriotica (UP) and the Partido Comunista Colombiano (PCC) have been receiving anonymous telephone calls and have been followed. On 26 October, the UP reportedly received information indicating that members of a paramilitary group had been contracted to kill leaders of the UP and PCC. AI is seriously concerned for their safety. "
