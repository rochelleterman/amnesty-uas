 Iran: Further information on fear of imminent execution/fear of flogging Leyla Mafi, (f) | Amnesty International 
 Leyla Mafi, aged about 20, is no longer facing the death penalty for ""morality-related"" offences. However, she still faces a sentence of flogging, and three and a half years in prison. Amnesty International opposes the use of flogging as a judicial punishment, and considers it to be cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment amounting to torture.
