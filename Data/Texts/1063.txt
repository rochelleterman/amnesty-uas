 NA 
 AI is concerned about reports of an alleged attempt to poison political prisoners Koigi wa Wamwere, Mirugi Kariuki and Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki on 9 January 1993 in Kamiti Prison. The prison authorities who have denied the allegation without offering independent verification. AI is also concerned that these prisoners are being denied regular access to their relatives, lawyers and doctors. Their health is reportedly deteriorating: Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki suffers from ""very high blood pressure"" but has been reportedly refused hospitalization. Political prisoner Rumba Kinuthia is being treated in hospital; he is being held under armed guard and is chained to his hospital bed each night. AI is concerned about the four men's well-being."
