 Iran: Prisoners of conscience/Medical concern | Amnesty International 
 In a crackdown on freedom of speech, the  authorities have arrested three prominent journalists,  Ahmad         Zeidabadi and Massoud Behnoud and   diabetic              Hojjatoleslam Hasan Yousefi Eshkevari,   researcher and   journalist. The diabetic  has reportedly   found it       difficult to obtain insulin in custody. Amnesty           International considers the three men to be prisoners of  conscience, detained solely for the legitimate            expression of their opinions.
