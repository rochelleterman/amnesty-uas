 Ecuador: Fear for safety/Death Threats, Lesbian, Gay,     Bisexual and Transgendered (LGBT) human rights            organizations. | Amnesty International 
 A homophobic group has said that in April it will start to kill members of the human rights organisation Quitogay, and to wipe out the rest of Ecuador's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) community. The threat comes at a time when the police themselves are accused of torturing and threatening to kill LGBT people. Amnesty International believes that the organisations, Quitogay, Quito; Equidad (Equality), Quito; Fundaci—n Amigos por la Vida (Friends for Life Foundation), Guayaquil; and Fundaci—n Ecuadoriana de Minor’as Sexuales (Ecuadorean Sexual Minorities Foundation), Guayaquil, and other LGBT people in Ecuador, are in grave danger.
