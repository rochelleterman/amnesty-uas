 USA (Florida): Death penalty: Leo Jones, black | Amnesty International 
 The above-named individual is scheduled to be executed on 24 March 1998.  He was sentenced to death for the murder of police officer Thomas Szafranski in 1981. Jones testified at his trial that, after his arrest, he had been coerced into making the confession. He testified that he had been beaten at the scene and later at the police station.  This was denied by the police and the trial court and subsequent appeals have ruled the confession to be valid.
