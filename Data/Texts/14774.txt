Threats have also been made against his wife and children. He was detained on 12 March 1993 and held incommunicado until 9 April when he was arrested by Diyarbakir State Security Court and sent to prison to await trial on charges of supporting the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK). Whilst in police custody he received threats and was reportedly severely tortured, and his family were told by members of the security forces that they had killed him and dumped his body near Diyarbakir. He was conditionally released from prison on 9 June, and has continued to receive death threats. "
