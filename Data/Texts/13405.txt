 Justice Soza of the Human Rights Task Force in Colombo has written to a number of UA participants informing them that Vishwanathan Pathmanathan may have been released. However, AI has established that he has not been released and that his whereabouts remain unknown. Justice Soza referred to a person called Vishvalingam Pathmanathan, believing him to be the same person, as both were arrested on the same day. "
