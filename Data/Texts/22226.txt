 NA 
 Soghra Najafpour has been sentenced to death, for the second time, for a murder which took place when she was only 13 years old. She has spent most of the last 19 years in prison. She was released on bail on 1 October 2007 but returned to prison later that month to comply with a summons which followed a new demand by the family of the murder victim for her execution to be carried out after they heard of her release."
