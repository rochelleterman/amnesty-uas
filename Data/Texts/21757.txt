 Bahrain: Detained Shi'a Muslims at risk | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A group of 23 opposition activists, clerics and human rights defenders have been accused in Bahrain of plotting to overthrow the government. Twenty-one of them, all men and all Shi'a Muslims, have been detained in what appears to be a clampdown before parliamentary elections on 23 October 2010. The men are held incommunicado and are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment."
