 NA 
 Six Zimbabwean activists who were arrested in February 2011 were convicted on 19 March on charges of “conspiracy to commit public violence” and sentenced two days later to carry out 420 hours community service and pay a fine of US$500 each. They were also sentenced to a two year suspended sentence, on the condition they do not commit a similar offence in the next five years and that they complete the community service."
