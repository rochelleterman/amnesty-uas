 The trial of the above-named men began in Nakuru on 12 April 1994. They are charged with attempted robbery with violence and, if convicted, face mandatory death sentences. AI believes that the charges may have been fabricated and that they may be prisoners of consciences. Koigi wa Wamwere, Charles Kuria Wamwere and James Maigwa are currently in Nakuru Prison where conditions are harsh. Two of the prisoners, Charles Kuria Wamwere and Godfrey Ngengi Njuguna have had health problems."
