 Guatemala:  Fear for safety -  Members of Casa Alianza | Amnesty International 
 The offices of Casa Alianza, an organisation helping street children, were broken into on 2 April, when their files were ransacked. The organisation is also concerned about two street girls allegedly raped by uniformed police officers. Amnesty International is concerned that the break-in may be linked to this.
