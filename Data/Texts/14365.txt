"Turkey: Forcible return 
 Turkey: Forcible return	 | Amnesty International 
 The Turkish authorities are preparing to forcibly return an Iranian-Kurdish family who are recognised refugees, to Iraq, where their lives would be in danger. Ayoub Parniyani, his wife Aysha Khaeirzade and son Komas Parniyani are now in a detention centre in the eastern province of Van. To return them to Iraq would be a clear violation of the principle of non-refoulement.
