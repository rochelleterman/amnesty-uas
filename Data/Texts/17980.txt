 Jordan: Fear of imminent execution / Torture / Unfair trial | Amnesty International 
 'Ali Jabbar Taher 'Ali could be executed at any time after the decision by the Court of Cassation (appeal court) in June to uphold the death sentence passed against him after an apparently unfair trial in January 2003. Amnesty International is also concerned at the death sentence passed against Jordanian national, Ward Amin 'Abd al-Qader 'Abdallah, who was tried and convicted for the same crime.
