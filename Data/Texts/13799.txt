 Vietnam/Cambodia: Forcible return/fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Over 100 ethnic minority Montagnard people were forcibly returned from Cambodia to Viet Nam on 20 July. Some of them may be at risk of serious human rights violations, including torture, but the group have been denied refugee status by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Amnesty International is concerned that other Montagnard asylum-seekers remaining in Cambodia may also be at risk of forcible return to Viet Nam.
