 Austin Mupandawana, Calisto Tsvangirai, Francis Musiniwa, Tongai Ndemberembe and 24 other Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) activists were released from Kadoma prison on 4 April. They were granted bail and are scheduled to appear in court on 9 April, to answer charges of destroying property. Though most of those arrested during the national ""stay-away"" have now been released, among the MDC activists still missing are eight activists reportedly abducted in the Budiriro and Mabvuku suburbs of Harare by supporters of the ruling ZANU-PF party.
