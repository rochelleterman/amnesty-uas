"Peru: Fear of torture: Jose Luis Bazan Adrianzen 
 Peru: Fear of torture: Jose Luis Bazan Adrianzen | Amnesty International 
 There is grave concern that Jose Luis Bazan Adrianzen, a former army intelligence agent attached to the Servicio de Inteligencia del Ejercito (SIE), Army Intelligence Service, may be at risk of torture. He was detained by police on 11 April 1997 and subsequently transferred into military custody, apparently on charges of desertion. His detention came in the wake of declarations he had made on Peruvian television about paramilitary activities.
