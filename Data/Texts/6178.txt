 There is concern for the safety of Axel Mejia, an educator with Casa Alianza, Covenant House, following renewed death threats against him, the most recent being on 20 February 1994. There is also concern for the safety of Coralia Perez from La Casa del Nino, a ""Mothers and Babies"" residence, run by Covenant House, following an attack on her by two men on 18 February. Coralia Perez noted the licence plates of their vehicles, which were identified as being of the type used by members of the security forces."
