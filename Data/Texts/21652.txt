 NA 
 Gheorghe Straisteanu, a prominent businessman and former Member of Parliament, was detained on 22 July 2005 while driving and alleges that police officers placed cannabis  and machine gun bullets in the back of his car to provide a pretext for detaining him.   He has been accused of     carrying out a series of robberies on car drivers.        Amnesty International  is concerned that Gheorghe         Straisteanu is being charged   on the basis of evidence   which has been extracted under   torture. The             organization is also concerned that Georghe  Straisteanu  is being detained arbitrarily.
