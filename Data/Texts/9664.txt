 USA (Alabama): Death Penalty/Legal concern, Anthony Ray   Hinton

 | Amnesty International 
 Anthony Hinton has been on death row in Alabama for 19 years for crimes he may not have committed. Three leading experts have concluded that the state's crucial ballistics evidence at the trial was wrong. Hinton's lawyers have recently filed an appeal in the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals seeking to get his conviction and death sentence overturned. If this fails, the case will go to the federal courts. Because of the deference that federal courts are required to give state court decisions in the USA, the current appeal is seen as his best chance to obtain a judicial remedy for his claim of innocence.
