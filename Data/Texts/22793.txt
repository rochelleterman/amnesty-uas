 Syria: Fears for Turkish journalists in Syria | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Turkish journalists Adem Özköse and Hamit Coşkun went missing while reporting on current events in northern Syria, close to the Turkish border. They were last heard from on 10 March 2012. They may have been subjected to enforced disappearance, which would put them at grave risk of torture and other ill-treatment."
