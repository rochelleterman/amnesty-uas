 According to a Sri Lankan radio report, the LTTE has confirmed that its former leader Gopalaswamy Mahendrarajah has been sentenced to death. They likely date of execution is 16 January 1994. The fate of supporters apparently detained with him is unclear. Reports continue of up to 120 of his followers being under sentence of death but an LTTE spokesperson in Paris has apparently said that the LTTE are holding only three people."
