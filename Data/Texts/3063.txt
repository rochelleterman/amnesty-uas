 Tanzania: Ill-treatment of government opponents - widespread arbitrary beatings and arrests of opposition   party supporters | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is very concerned by continuing     police violence in Zanzibar, over more than a week now,   against supporters of the Civic United Front (CUF)        opposition party. More  than 300 CUF supporters have been beaten by police and  more than 100 others arrested,      mostly on trumped-up criminal charges such as vagrancy.   Police also shot  Abdallah Khamis, who is being treated   in hospital. Those  in police custody are reportedly      being refused medical    treatment for their injuries.
