 Chad: death penalty: Yachoub Issaskha and three others (in absentia) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Yachoub Issaskha was sentenced to death on 20 November 1994 along with three others, who were tried in absentia. They were among nine people accused of attacking the local population of Gniguilim at a market place in August 1993. AI is concerned that he was defended at trial by judge's assistants rather than by lawyers and that he no right of appeal to a higher court. Unless he is granted clemency by President Deby, AI fears he may be executed in public in the near future."
