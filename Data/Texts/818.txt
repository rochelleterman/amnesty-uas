 The first three above-named staff members of the Oromo Relief Association were arrested on 21 September and are reportedly held incommunicado and without charge.  The other two were arrested on 29 September.  In view of previous arrests and torture of several ORA officials in 1993 and 1994, AI fears these five ORA staff may be ill-treated."
