 Peru: Death threat / fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Jose Antonio Alvarez Pachas, Rosa Neyra Samalvides (f), his wife: There is serious concern for the safety of the two journalists named above following delivery of a written death threat to their home on 4 April 1997. They have also received numerous intimidating telephone calls. There is further concern that the authorities have failed to initiate an investigation or taken any steps to protect them. Jose Antonio Alvarez is a former prisoner of conscience who was released on 1 October 1996 after spending over four years in prison unjustly accused of terrorism. His wife, Rosa Neyra, was also detained in June 1992 but later acquitted. Both have publicly criticized the prison conditions in which they and other prisoners were held.
