 Abderhamane Mehalli was arrested at his home in the Bachdjarah district of Algiers on 26 December 2006 by a group of plain-clothes security force officers, believed to include members of a military intelligence agency known as the D‰partement du renseignement et de la s‰curit‰, DRS, the Department for Information and Security. Amnesty International fears that he is being arbitrarily and illegally detained by the DRS in a military barracks in Algiers, part of which is used as a secret detention centre, and that he is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.
