 Picas Damane, Charles Ble Goude, Souleymane Kamarate, Sylvanus Gore: Picas Damane, deputy secretary general of the Federation estudiantine et scolaire de Cote d'Ivoire (FESCI, Ivorian Federation of Student and School Pupils), and three other FESCI leaders have been held incommunicado since 19 December and there are fears they may be at risk of ill-treatment. They appear to be prisoners of conscience, held because of their membership of FESCI, an organization which the government claims has been outlawed.
