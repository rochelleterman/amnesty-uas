 Philippines: Imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is increasingly concerned that Roberto Lara and Roderick Licayan will be executed by lethal injection on 30 January 2004. These will be the first executions to take place since President Gloria Arroyo lifted a moratorium on executions in December 2003 for prisoners convicted of kidnapping or drug trafficking offences.
