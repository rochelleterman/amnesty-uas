 The eight men named above have been sentenced to death for murdering 52 people from Dalalchak-Baghhaura village, Bihar, in May 1987, apparently in retaliation for the killing of six peasant leaders by members of upper castes. All are peasants from Baghhaura village aged between 23 and 55 years old. They were sentenced on 4 November 1992 by the Additional Sessions judge of Aurangabad district court. Their appeal is currently before the High Court in Patna, Bihar. Their lawyers allege that they were convicted solely on the evidence of a single eye-witness, an eight-year-old boy, and that three of the men were not present at the time of the occurrence."
