 Oscar Humberto Duarte PaÁz (m), a senior member of a local development organisation (Association for the Development of Quetzal City), has been kidnapped. Other members (including Renâ GuzmÊn Qui_¢nez, David Alarc¢n and Josâ Cuellar) have been intimidated, since the organisation attempted to mediate between police and the local community. Amnesty International believes the kidnapped man's life is at risk, and his colleagues are in grave danger.
