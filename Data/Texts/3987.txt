 Brazil: Further information on fear for safety: Wagner dos Santos | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI has received information from the Brazilian government confirming that on 26 October 1995, by decision of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Wagner dos Santos was escorted by officials of the Department of Federal Police to a secret location in order to secure his safety. At this delicate stage in the proceedings, witnesses, lawyers for the prosecution, state prosecutors and the judge involved in the Candelaria trial may be particularly vulnerable to threats and assaults. AI continues to be concerned for their safety."
