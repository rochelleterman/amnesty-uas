 Elman and Elshan Hasanov were sentenced to death for the murder of seven people on 8 June 1994 by the Supreme Court of Azerbaijan. As there is no court of higher jurisdiction, the two are unable to lodge an appeal. A petition for clemency to the President is their only hope of avoiding execution."
