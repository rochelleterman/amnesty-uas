 Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories/Egypt: Medical concern | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Israeli authorities are preventing critically ill Palestinians in the Gaza Strip from leaving in order to access treatment which cannot be obtained in Gaza. Nufuz Husni, Muhammad al-Hurani, Rami Al-Arouqi, Karima Abu Dalal, Rami al-Masri, and Sameer Taleb and at least nine others, all with cancer or other life-threatening illnesses, have been denied permission to access potentially life-saving treatment outside Gaza in the last few weeks.
