 People's Republic of China: death penalty: Yu Liehai and four others | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 22 February 1995, the ""Peasants' Daily"" newspaper reported the sentencing to death of five Public Security Bureau officers in Changzhi, Shanxi Province, for causing death while attempting to extract confessions through torture. While AI welcomes the investigation of allegations of torture and the prosecution of officials involved in torture, the organization is opposed to the death penalty in all cases. AI is therefore calling for the sentences to be commuted."
