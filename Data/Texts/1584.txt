 AI is concerned about the continued detention, without charge or trial, of detainees accused of involvement in a coup plot whose existence is increasingly doubted. There is particular concern for the health of 78-year-old chief Meredith Adisa Akinloye, who has reportedly been held incommunicado and without access to required medication for high blood pressure at Ikoyi Prison, Lagos, since 9 March 1995. AI believes that he and others among those arrested are prisoners of conscience and is calling for their immediate and unconditional release."
