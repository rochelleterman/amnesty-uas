 Faraj Sarkouhi; and new names: Isma'il Sarkouhi, his brother, Parvin Ardalan (f), assistant to Faraj: There continues to be concern for the safety of Faraj Sarkouhi, the editor of Adineh magazine, and now also his brother Isma'il, who have both been missing since 27 January 1997. His assistant at the magazine, Parvin Ardalan, has been missing since 24 January. There is concern that they may be held as prisoners of conscience in unacknowledged detention. There is also concern at unconfirmed reports that his mother and brother-in-law have also been interrogated, and that other writers in Iran who were among 134 signatories to an open letter calling for an end to censorship, have received threats from Hizbollah.
