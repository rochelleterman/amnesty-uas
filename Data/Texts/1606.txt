 Nigeria: Fear of ill-treatment / possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Sabina Solayide Iluyomade, aged 54, primary school proprietor and teacher, Folake Folasade Iluyomade, aged 31, her daughter: These two women are reported to have been arrested and detained solely because they are the wife and daughter of Raphael Iluyomade, a supporter of the pro-democracy movement living in the United States. They were arrested on 19 February 1997 at their home in the Bodija district of Ibadan and there is concern that they are probably prisoners of conscience and that they may be at risk of ill-treatment in incommunicado detention without charge or trial. There is further concern that Sabina Solayide Iluyomade's health may be at risk, as she suffers from diabetes.
