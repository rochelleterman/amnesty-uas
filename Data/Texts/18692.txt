 Syria / Italy: Forcible return/Incommunicado detention/fear of torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned at the reported        incommunicado detention of Syrian citizen Muhammad Sa'id  al-Sakhri, his wife Maysun Lababidi and their four        children. Italian authorities forcibly returned them to   Syria on 28 November and their relatives have not heard   from them since. It is feared that they may be held at    one of the Syrian intelligence interrogation centres in   Damascus, where torture of detainees is routine.
