 Syria: Fear of torture/incommunicado detention/prisoner of conscience: Dr 'Ammar Qurabi (m), human rights defender

 | Amnesty International 
 Human rights defender Dr 'Ammar Qurabi was arrested on 12 March, on arrival at Damascus airport. He was reportedly arrested by Military Intelligence officers, and is believed to be held in the Military Intelligence Palestine Branch detention centre in the capital, Damascus. He is held incommunicado, putting him in serious danger of torture and other ill-treatment. Amnesty International believes he is held solely for his legitimate and peaceful work in defence of human rights, and considers him a prisoner of conscience.
