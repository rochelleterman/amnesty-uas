 AI is alarmed by reports of the existence of a ""hit-list"" of some 40 people in the town of Xinguara, Para state. Six of those reportedly on the list are already dead, two others have been attacked and several more have fled the area. Those named above have reportedly been singled out because of their links with peasant farmers involved in local land conflicts. Father Ricardo Rezende received a telephoned death threat on 23 September 1994."
