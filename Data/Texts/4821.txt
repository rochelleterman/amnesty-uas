 Colombia: Fear for Safety | Amnesty International 
 Journalist Jineth Bedoya was abducted and tortured by     paramilitaries, who told her repeatedly of a lista negra, death list, of journalists they had sentenced to death,   including her and four of her colleagues. Amnesty         International is concerned that those responsible may be  planning a campaign of terror against other               journalists.
