 NA 
 Hebe de Bonafini, President of the human rights organization Madres de Plaza de Mayo, Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, has reportedly been subjected to death threats at her home on 5 August 1993 in the city of La Plata. The threats followed her denunciation the previous night, during a broadcast on La Plata FM Radio Futura Station, of the killing of five adolescents in Buenos Aires Province, allegedly by members of police. Although there is no direct evidence of the involvement of the security forces in the incident at her home, there is concern for her safety. "
