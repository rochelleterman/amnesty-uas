 The first nine men named above were arrested between 21 and 27 December 1992; they are apparently suspected by the authorities of being members of the banned Sudan Communist Party. They are being held incommunicado; the place of detention is unknown but it is likely that they are either in the security headquarters in Khartoum or in one of the secret detention centres, or ""ghost houses"", run by the security service. A tenth man, Abdul Rahman Abdulla Salin Tout, was reportedly arrested on 5 January 1993, also suspected of membership of the SCP. His place of detention is also unknown.
