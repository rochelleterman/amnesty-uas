 AI is deeply concerned about reports that some of the sentences in connection with the Saderat Bank trial, including the death sentence passed on Fazel Khodadad, have been confirmed by the Supreme Court in Iran. At least two others, Ebrahim Aria and Jamshid Arghand, who were sentenced to ten years' imprisonment and 30 lashes each, are also reported to have had their sentences confirmed."
