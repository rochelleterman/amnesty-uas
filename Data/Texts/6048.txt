 Guatemala: fear for safety: Alma Mayan, Armando Cu Moran and others at the Centro Fray Bartolome de las Casas | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about a recent break-in at the Christian-based Centro Fray Bartolome de las Casas, during which a member of staff was attacked. Alma Mayan, the Centre's secretary, suprised two intruders on 4 January 1995. They attacked and beat her, leaving her dazed. This is the second such break-in at the Centre. Two armed intruders broke in on 27 October 1994; on that occasion they also beat Alma Mayan and questioned her about the activities of the Centre's director, Armando Cu Moran."
