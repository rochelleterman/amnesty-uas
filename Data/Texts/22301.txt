 Hassanpourâ€™s death sentence was overturned by the Supreme Court on 3 September 2008. The Head of the Judiciary ordered that because he had been convicted of charges which did not amount to moharebeh (enmity with God), he should be retried on the charge of espionage. A branch of the Revolutionary Court in Marivan is now known to have reimposed the death penalty on Abdolwahed (Hiwa) Butimar on 14 April 2008. There is no further information on Kurdish journalist Mansour Tayfouri."
