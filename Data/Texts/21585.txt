 The hearings of Lema Susarov's appeal against the Ukrainian authorities' rejection of his application for refugee status, and against the order to extradite him to the Russian federation, began on 9 and 10 June 2008 respectively. The prosecutor at the 10 June extradition hearing said that information on the risks Lema Susarov would face if sent to the Russian Federation was ""not relevant,"" and that Lema Susarov could not be considered a refugee."
