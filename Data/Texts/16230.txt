 The above-named are activists in the outlawed Erk (Freedom) political party. Their trial, on charges of preparing anti-state violence, is to resume in the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan, on 30 January 1995. AI is concerned that confessions, possibly made under torture, are being used in their prosecution. The six male defendants have been detained for up to nine months. One of them, Erkin Ashurov, is reported to be in need of medical attention for diabetes, rheumatism and radiculitis."
