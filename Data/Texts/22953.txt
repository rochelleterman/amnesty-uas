 Yemen: Stop families suffering in the name of security | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A telephone call told the family of 18-year-old Najib     al-Hijri that he was detained by political security       forces in the city of Sana'a, Yemen. Yet, when they tried to visit him, they were told by officials that he was not there. Although Najib was eventually found, he still has  no access to lawyers, and has no idea even of when his    case will be heard. The impact on his family is immense."
