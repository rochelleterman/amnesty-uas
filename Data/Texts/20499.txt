 USA (Virginia): Death penalty / Legal concern: Edward Nathaniel Bell (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Edward Bell is due to be executed in Virginia at 9pm local time on 19 February 2009. He was sentenced to death in 2001 for the murder of a police officer in 1999.  Edward Bell, who was convicted on largely circumstantial evidence, has consistently maintained his innocence of the murder. There are serious questions about the quality of his legal representation at trial, and his appeal lawyers argue that he may have mental retardation. "
