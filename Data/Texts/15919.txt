 Aleksandr Porokhnya's petition for clemency is due to be examined by the Presidential Clemency Commission shortly. An unofficial source has claimed that in response to international pressure, it was decided in June 1994 to grant him clemency. The source alleges, however, that clemency was granted instead to another prisoner on death row with a name similar to Aleksandr Porokhnya's."
