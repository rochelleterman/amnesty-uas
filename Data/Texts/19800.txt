 NA 
 On 27 February, a work vehicle being driven by Miguel González was shot at by two men on a motorcycle. The shot narrowly missed him. González, regional director ofthe Centro de Estudios Jurídicos e Investigación Social (CEJIS), which promotes the rights of Indigenous and peasant communities, had been followed three days earlier. Following the recent attack Miguel González filed a complaint with both the police and the Public Prosecutor’s Office in the town of Trinidad. However, so far no protection has been provided. He and his family have left their home in Trinidad to go into hiding. Amnesty International is seriously concerned for Miguel González's safety. "
