 NA 
 On 20 October more than 10 armed men entered the fishing village of Peam Charalai, Kampong Chhnang province and killed seven ethnic Vietnamese, three of them children. The attackers are believed to have been members of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK) - the Khmer Rouge. Against a background of a similar pattern of attacks there is grave concern that there will be further killings unless the Government take action to halt such attacks and provide adequate protection to its ethnic Vietnamese communities."
