 Survivors and relatives of victims of a massacre of at least 20 Paez Indians on 16 December 1991 have reported threats and harassment by armed civilians who appear to operate freely in the area despite the fact that it has been militarized. Lawyers working on behalf of the victims have reportedly also been threatened. Offical investigations into the 1991 massacre found evidence of police involvement, though these findings have yet to be made public. Documentation relating to the investigation has reportedly gone missing from the lawyers' offices. "
