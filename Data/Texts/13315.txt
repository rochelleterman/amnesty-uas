 NA 
 Flor Contemplacion, a Filipino monther of four, is scheduled to be hanged on 17 March 1995. She was sentenced to death in 1993 for the murder of another Filipino maid and her employer's four-year-old son. There are serious doubts about the fairness of her trial. It is believed that she may have been convicted solely on the basis of a confession and that the courts have failed to consider evidence of mental illness. Two appeals against the death sentence have been rejected."
