 The appeal of the 14 people named above will be heard on 5 July 1994. They were sentenced to two years' imprisonment on 14 June after an unfair trial. They are prisoners of conscience. They were arrested in Guercif on 3 June after protesting peacefully about unemployment. All are members of an association of unemployed graduates. They have alleged that they were subject to torture and ill-treatment during their incommunicado detention in police custody, but no medical examination has been allowed by the court."
