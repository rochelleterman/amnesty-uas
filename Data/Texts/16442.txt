 Besim Sokol Rama, Avni Smajl Nura, Idriz Halit Asllani, ethnic Albanians: The three men named above were indicted at the end of March 1997. There remains concern that Besim Rama and Avni Nura were arrested and illegally detained incommunicado from 17 September to the beginning of October 1996. There is further concern at allegations that they were ill-treated following their arrest, and that they have allegedly made statements before a court without their lawyers being present.
