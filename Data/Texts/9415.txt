 The execution of Henry Dunn, which was due to take place in Texas on the evening of 14 May 2002, was blocked by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Henry Dunn's previous appeal lawyers had missed filing deadlines, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit had dismissed his case. The execution was blocked following an appeal based on whether there can be any reconsideration of this outcome. While the Fifth Circuit has not yet ruled, the order it issued on 13 May had the effect of dissolving the execution date.
