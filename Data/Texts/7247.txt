 UA 336/92 - Mexico: death threats: Maria Teresa Jardi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Maria Teresa Jardi, Director of the Department of Solidarity and the Defence of Human Rights in the Archdioces of Mexico and legal adviser to the Commission of Solidarity and Defence of Human Rights (COSYDDHAC), has received recently three written death threats. The letters warned that she and her family would suffer the consequences if she did not stop her human rights work. One of the threats refers to her investigation into the murder of Victor Manuel Oropeza, a journalist and political activist who had himself received death threats prior to his murder after publishing a series of articles critical of the judicial police and a former Deputy Attorney General in charge of anti-narcotics investigations.
