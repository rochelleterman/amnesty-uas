 Democratic Republic of Congo: Ill-treatment/arbitrary arrest/ unlawful killing | Amnesty International 
 Over 200 people, including up to 100 street children, have been arrested by police in Kinshasa, after a violent demonstration that followed a fatal police shooting. Some of the children are only five or six years old, and are being held in conditions likely to endanger their health. Some of the detainees were beaten during their arrest and are said to require medical treatment. Arrests of street children, apparently arbitrary, are continuing.
