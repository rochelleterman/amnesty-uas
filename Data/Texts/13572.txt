 The three men named above have been sentenced to death and face execution. Their appeals are reported to have been exhausted, in spite of expressions of concern from the Prosecutor General and their lawyers that their trials were unfair. The evidence used to convict them was reportedly contradictory and incomplete. The men were sentenced to death on charges of robbery, rape and murder."
