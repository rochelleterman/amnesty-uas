 Egypt: Forcible return / fear of torture or other ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Egyptian authorities forcibly returned a group of around 200 asylum-seekers to Eritrea in the night of 11 June 2008, and are preparing to forcibly return a further 1,400. In Eritrea they will be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Egypt has not been granted access to any of the Eritreans to assess their asylum claims, despite repeated requests. The authorities appear to have scheduled a number of special flights to Eritrea."
