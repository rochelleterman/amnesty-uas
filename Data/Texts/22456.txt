 Israel: Demolition of Bedouin village imminent | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Around 250 residents, one third of them children, of the Bedouin village al-â€˜Araqib in southern Israel are facing forcible eviction from their land and the destruction of their property for the seventh time since July. Although residents have a long-established claim to the area and are Israeli citizens, the Israeli government does not recognize their rights to the land."
