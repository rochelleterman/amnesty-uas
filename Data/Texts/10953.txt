 China: Further information on Death Penalty/imminent execution: Nepalese citizens: Ishwori Kumar Shrestha (m) and Rabi Dahal (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 The two Nepalese men named above received a retrial on 13 October. Although in itself a retrial is highly unusual in the Chinese justice system, and is almost certainly a reflection of the international pressure surrounding this case, it resulted in Rabi Dahal's death sentence being confirmed. His appeal hearing may take place in the next few weeks; if it fails, he is likely to be executed shortly afterwards.
