 Mexico: Fear for safety/torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 State police violently evicted a group of Nahua Indigenous peasant farmers on 14 June from a piece of land they had occupied, whose ownership is contested. They arrested 11 people, including Javier Islas Cruz, and reportedly beat them, using   torture and ill-treatment   during their interrogation about the land occupation and  their supposed links with a guerrilla group. The leader   of the peasant group, Gabino Flores Cruz, has not been    seen since the eviction. There is a warrant for his       arrest. All those in custody are at risk of further       ill-treatment or torture.
