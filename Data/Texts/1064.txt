 The three opposition members of parliament and three others named above are being held in Nakuru prison. They were arrested on 15 January 1995 in Longonot, near the scene of recent political violence which claimed 10 lives. They were about to attend a church service with families of the victims. AI believes that they are prisoners of conscience, detained for their non-violent opposition to the government, and is calling for their immediate release."
