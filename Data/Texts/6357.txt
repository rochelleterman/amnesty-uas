 Arturo Mendez and Alfonso Morales, of the Maya-Mam ethnic group, were arrested on 22 April 1994 by police in the municipality of Huehuetenango. They have reportedly been accused by members of the Civil Defence Patrols, PAC, of the assassination on 15 September 1993 of the leader of the local PAC. Fears for their safety have been heightened by reports that Alfonso Morales has been beaten in detention. They are being held at Huehuetenango prison."
