 Honduras: Attacks on journalists must stop | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Media workers in Honduras have been under attack since Roberto Micheletti seized power on 28 June. Since 23 September, a radio station director says he has been threatened, and a newspaper photographer has been abducted and tortured. Micheletti issued a decree on 26 September allowing newspapers and broadcasters to be closed down if they ""insult public officials."" A radio station and a television channel have since been taken off the air. "
