 China: Fear of torture/medical concern/prisoner of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Political activist Hada has been routinely tortured at the prison in northern China where he is serving a 15-year sentence for ""separatism"" and ""espionage"". Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for the exercise of his right to freedom of expression and association, and fears he is at risk of further torture. His health is reportedly failing and he is suffering from psychological problems as a result of the torture.
