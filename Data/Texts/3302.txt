 UA 138/93 - Zaire: ""disappearance"": Kenge Mukengeshayi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 It has been reported that Kenge Mukengeshayi, editor-in-chief of Le Phare newspaper, was abducted from his house by uniformed men at night on or around the 22 April 1993. Members of the elite Special Presidential Division (DSP) or the Garde Civile are suspected of being behind his abduction, following his publication of a story accusing President Mobutu of being behind a plot to assassinate Etienne Tshisekedi, the opposition leader appointed Prime Minister. Attempts by his relatives to trace his whereabouts have so far been unsuccessful and there are fears that he may have ""disappeared"". "
