 Sudan: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/incommunicado detention/detention without charge/possible prisoner of conscience, Edward Terso Lado | Amnesty International 
 Edward Terso Lado, journalist on the English language newspaper the Khartoum Monitor, was arrested by members of the security forces on 11 March. He has not been charged with any offence, and is currently reportedly being held incommunicado at an unknown location. He is allegedly at risk of torture. Amnesty International believes he may be a prisoner of conscience held solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression.
