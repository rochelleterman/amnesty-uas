 Saudi Arabia: Further Information on Possible prisoner of conscience/Torture and ill-treatment/Incommunicado detention | Amnesty International 
 According to reports, Jam'an al-Ghamdi and at least one other person are still being held at a prison in Riyadh following later protests on 23 October 2003. Amnesty International fears that all those detained in connection with the demonstrations may be held solely for their non-violent expression of their politically held beliefs and as such may be possible prisoners of conscience.
