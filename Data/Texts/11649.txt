 The public prosecutor in Malang, East Java, announced in late July 1994 that East Timorese human rights activist Jose Antonio Neves would soon be tried. Another activist, Pedor Fatima Tilman, is currently on trial in East Timor and a third, Rosalino dos Santos, has been sentenced to 20 months in prison. AI considers all of them to be prisoners of conscience and urges the Indonesian Government to release them immediately and unconditionally."
