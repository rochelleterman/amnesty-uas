 Community activists and members of an Indigenous community protesting against the construction of a wind farm in Oaxaca, southern Mexico, were attacked and injured on 28 October 2011. Amnesty International is concerned that the death of a man at the scene of the protests may be used to unfairly prosecute protestors and to deter future protests. "
