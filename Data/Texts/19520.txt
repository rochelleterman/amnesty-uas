 Kenya: Medical Action: The role of medical evidence in prosecuting cases of sexual assault. | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Victims of rape often face insurmountable obstacles in    trying to bring the perpetrators to justice. Many women   who have suffered rape or other forms of abuse are too    intimidated by cultural attitudes and state inaction to   seek redress. This action looks at the role doctors can   play in helping to secure successful prosecution of       perpetrators by providing medical evidence.
