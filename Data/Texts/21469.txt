 NA 
 Zarema Gaisanova, a 39-year-old Chechen woman, was abducted on 31 October 2009 in the Chechen capital, Grozny, in the Russian Federation's North Caucasus region. It appears that law enforcement officials may have been responsible for her abduction. She has not been seen since then. Zarema Gaisanova's mother was told by a representative of the Public Prosecutorâ€™s office that she was alive, but he could not give her more information. "
