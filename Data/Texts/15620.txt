 Russian Federation: Further information on possible prisoner of conscience / fear of death penalty / health concern and new concern: prisoner of conscience: Alexander Nikitin | Amnesty International 
 The above, a 44-year-old retired naval officer, has been formally charged with treason in the form of espionage, release of state secrets and falsification of documents. Amnesty International, however, has concluded that he is being held solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression, and has adopted him as a prisoner of conscience. The accusation against Aleksandr Nikitin stems from his gathering of material for Bellona's report ""Sources of radioactive contamination: The Russian Northern Fleet"" about accidents on nuclear submarines and consequences for the environment.
