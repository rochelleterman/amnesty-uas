 Ahmed Afifi and Mohamed Taher were arrested while participating at a peaceful protest in the city of Alexandria on 23 July 2008. It is not known where they are held and Amnesty International fears they are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Ahmed Maher and 13 other protesters are also in custody but are not believed to be at risk of torture nor other ill-treatment. Amnesty International believes all 16 to be prisoners of conscience, detained for their participation in the protest. "
