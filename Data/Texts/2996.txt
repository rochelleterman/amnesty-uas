 Sudan: Further information on Death Penalty / Unfair trial | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has learnt that following their appeal before a Special Appeal Court, Al-Doum Adam Abaker Ali, Mohammad Omer Suliman Ahmad and 23 other men tried with them have had their death sentences confirmed. Their lawyers have appealed to the Supreme Court. Amnesty International is concerned that the death penalty has been imposed following a judicial process that falls far short of international standards for fair trials.
