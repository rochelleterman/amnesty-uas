 UA 414/94 - Equatorial Guinea: torture / medical concern: Jorge Ondo Esono, Antonio Abogo, Marcos Manuel Ngongo | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Jorge Ondo Esono and Antonio Abogo, arrested on 19 November 1994 are reportedly being subjected to severe beatings by rubber baton. The two men, both members of the Convergence for Social Democracy (CPDS), were arrested in Akonibe shortly before they were due to attend a CPDS conference in Bata. Marcos Manuel Ndongo, the CPDS delegate for Europe, was arrested on 23 November. He suffers from a heart complaint, and on 24 November, was allowed a visit from a doctor. On 25 November he was reportedly questioned for four hours. The three men appear to have been arrested solely on account of their peaceful political activities."
