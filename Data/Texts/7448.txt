 Mexico: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 On 6 June, an anonymous phone call was made to the family-run shop of Noâ Aguirre Orozco warning him that his life is in danger. The threat appears to be linked to his environmental work as part of a group campaigning against the construction of a tourist development in the municipality of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero State and the contamination of a local bay. Amnesty International is seriously concerned for his safety.
