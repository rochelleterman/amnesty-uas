 Philippines: Further information on death penalty: Leo Pilo Echegaray | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International understands that the Supreme Court is still considering the appeal lodged by Pilo Echegaray's lawyer against his death sentence. A leading association of human rights lawyers in Philippines (FLAG) filed a supplementary appeal on his behalf. The judge concerned has gained notoriety in the country for founding an organization known as the ""Guillotine Club"" whose members are all reported to be judges who have passed death sentences and are perceived by the public to be strong advocates of the death penalty.
