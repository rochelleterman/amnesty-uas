 On 19 July 1994 Geoffrey Kuria Kariuki, John Kinyanjui, Michael Kung'u, George Murangu and Joseph Ngimithi Githire were jointly charged with robbery with violence, possession of firearms and ammunition. All six have reportedly been tortured and have injuries. Following an application by defence lawyers, the senior resident magistrate ruled that all six be examined by a government doctor or their own private doctor if no other is available. Anthony Njuguna Njui has not been arrested as previously reported. Jimmy James Waigwa was released without charge on 13 July. George Murangu and Joseph Ngimithi Githire were arrested on 9/10 and 11/12 July respectively. Neither are known to be connected to Koigi wa Wamwere."
