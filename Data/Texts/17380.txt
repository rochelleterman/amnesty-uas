 Iran: Fear of torture/ Possible prisoner of conscience: Mohammad Sadiq Kabudvand (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Iranian Kurdish journalist and human rights defender Mohammad Sadiq Kabudvand is detained in an unknown place, possibly Section 209 of Evin Prison. He was arrested on 1 July 2007 at his place of work in Tehran by plain-clothed security officers. Amnesty International is concerned that he may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment and believes he is very likely to be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and association.
