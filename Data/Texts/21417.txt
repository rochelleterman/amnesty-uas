 The health of Zubair Isaevich Zubairaev, a Chechen imprisoned in Volgograd, southern Russia, has deteriorated. He is not receiving adequate medical care, and the authorities at the prison colony where he is held neither provide any medication nor pass on the expensive medicines that his family members buy for him. Reports suggest that he is still being beaten and has been threatened. His life may be in danger."
