 On 1 September 1995 Park Yong-gil spent her 76th birthday in Seoul Detention Centre. Activists in South Korea are concerned about her health as she suffers from heart disease and has reportedly had attacks of chest pain in detention. Doctors from outside the prison have not been allowed to visit her and her meetings with friends and relatives have reportedly been restricted. AI continues to call for her immediate and unconditional release as a prisoner of conscience."
