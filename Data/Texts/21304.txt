 Milan authorities forcibly evicted a community of about 150 Roma people living under an overpass in the north of the city early in the morning of 31 March.  According to local newspapers, 70 out of about 150 Roma people were dispersed without being given alternative accommodation. Some families had been already rehoused in temporary shelters provided by NGOs. One family accepted temporary shelter in the cityâ€™s dormitory."
