 Dovud Nazriev and his elder brother Sherali, who were sentenced to death in May 2001, could be executed at any time unless the president grants clemency. They were convicted for attempting to assassinate the mayor of Dushanbe, but there are reports that they are innocent, sentenced after an unfair trial, and that they were ill-treated in custody.
