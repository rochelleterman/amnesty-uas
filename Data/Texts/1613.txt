 Ken Saro-Wiwa has been held incommunicado since his arrest on 22 May 1994. While held in Bori Military Camp, Port Harcourt, he is said to have been held in leg irons which resulted in swelling of one of his legs. He also suffers from a heart complaint for which he is not receiving medical attention. Amnesty International is calling for his release as a prisoner of conscience and that of other members of the Ogoni community who are prisoners of conscience. They include Ledum Mitee, Barinem Kiobel and others who are thought to be held without charge at Bori Military Camp."
