 EXTRA 65/93 - USA (Missouri): death penalty: Frederick Lashley | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Frederick Lashley, black, is scheduled to be executed on 28 July 1993. He was convicted and sentenced to death by an all-white jury in 1982. There are doubts about the fairness of procedures used in the case. In March 1992 his sentence was vacated by the US Court of Appeals on grounds of error by the trial court, but in 7-2 majority verdict, issued on 8 March 1993, the US Supreme Court reversed the decision."
