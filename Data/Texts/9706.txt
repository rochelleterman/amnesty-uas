 USA: Fear for safety / legal concern: Proposed legislation threatens the safety of children
 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that a bill which may  come before the US congress within weeks could threaten   the safety of children accused or convicted of criminal   offences by allowing them to be incarcerated with adults  in violation of international standards.  A provision in  one version of the bill also weakens the requirement to   tackle racial discrimination in the treatment of children coming into contact with the law.  AI urges that the      proposed legislation include an obligation to separate    detained children from adult detainees.
