 Nine ethnic Albanian former police employees arrested in November and December 1994 are due to go on trial on 5 April 1995 before the district court of Pec (see names above). There are the first among some 130 former police employees detained since November 1994 on charges of seeking to undermine Yugoslavia's territorial integrity by force to be tried. Lawyers have repeatedly alleged that many of the defendants were tortured or ill-treated after arrest to extract confessions."
