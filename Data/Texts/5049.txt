 AI continues to be seriously concerned for the safety of Astrid Liliana Gonzalez Jaramillo and Sandra del Pilar Ubate Monroy, who have been targets of death threats and warned not to testify to the Office of the Attorney General of the City of Cali which is conducting investigations into the ""disappearance"" of John Ricardo Ubate and Gloria Bogota. Fears for the safety of the two women have increased following an apparent attempt to abduct Astrid Liliana Gonzalez on 15 September 1995. It is believed that this attempt was carried out by the Anti-kidnapping and Extortion Unit."
