 Angela Maria Contreras Chavez, a student of anthropology aged 24, has been subjected to a series of threats and acts of intimidation, the latest of which occured on 11 April 1993. In 1991 she began working with a team of forensic doctors conducting exhumations of victims of the early 1980s counter insurgency campaign. In February 1993 she stopped work on this project and began documenting cases of ""disappearances"" with the GAM organization. AI is seriously concerned for her safety. "
