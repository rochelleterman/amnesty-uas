 UA 07/94 - Guatemala: fear for safety / torture: Vicente Gonzalez Canahui, two indigenous girls aged 14 and 16 | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Vicente Gonzalez Canahui, following his denunciation of an attack and threats to two young indigenous girls in Canton San Pedro, municipality of San Miguel Chicaj, department of Baja Verapaz. According to reports, on 1 January 1994 the two young girls were approached by six armed men, including the local Head of Military Commissioners. The men forced them to drink alcohol and abducted them. The girls later alleged that they were raped. When Vicente Gonzalez went to the 4th military detachment of Salama on 10th January, as a representative of the villagers, he was apparently insulted and threatened. The girls have not made a denunciation to the courts for fear of reprisals."
