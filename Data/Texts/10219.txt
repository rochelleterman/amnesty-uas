 On 10 May, Enmary Cava was shot six times by an unknown man in the town of Cagua in the State of Aragua. She remains in a critical condition in hospital, as does a female friend of hers who was also shot three times. Few details have as yet come to light, but Amnesty International is concerned that the incident could be related to the escalating death threats that Enmary Cava and members of her family Dinorah Mar’a D’az Loreto, Jairo Alexis D’az Loreto, Bladimir D’az, Miguel D’az Loreto, Alexandra Gualdron have been receiving, allegedly from agents of the Aragua State Police.
