 A man went to the Mésilien family home on 19 December 2007 pretending to be a journalist seeking to confirm a report that Wilson Mésilien had been kidnapped. Fearing for their lives, Wilson Mésilien, his wife and four children went into hiding. Their lives are in grave danger. He has been running the Fondasyon Trant Septanm since 12 August, when the human rights organisation's coordinator, Lovinsky Pierre-Antoine, was kidnapped. Lovinsky Pierre-Antoine’s whereabouts are still unknown."
