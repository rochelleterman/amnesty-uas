 Costa Rica: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Reina Xiomara Zelaya Gonzalez and her daughters: Maryuri Johanna Zelaya Gonzalez, aged 6 (f), Stephania Xiomara Caballero Zelaya, aged 12 (f), Cynthia Lorena Caballero Zelaya, aged 13 (f): Reina Xiomara Zelaya, who fled to Costa Rica witih her daughters in February 1996 after receiving death threats in her native Honduras, is once again in fear for her life. During the past two weeks she has been subjected to surveillance and harassment in Heredia, Costa Rica, apparently by members of the Honduran security forces. The targeting of Reina Zelaya is believed to be a result of the fact that the father of two of her daughters is Florencio Caballero, a former member of the Honduran military intelligence unit who has testified during investigations into past human rights violations in Honduras and is currently seeking asylum in Canada.
