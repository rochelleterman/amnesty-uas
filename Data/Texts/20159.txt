 Honduras: Honduras set to ban emergency contraceptive | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Honduras is on the verge of becoming the only country in the world that criminalises the emergency contraceptive pill due to a Supreme Court conclusion that a ban is not unconstitutional. Women and girls who have been raped or whose contraceptive method has failed will no longer have the option of emergency contraception. The fundamental rights of Honduran women and girls are in jeopardy."
