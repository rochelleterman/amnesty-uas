 The Phnom Penh Municipal authorities have indicated this week that the families living at Borei Keila will be forcibly evicted sometime in the next few days.  Around 32 families living with HIV and AIDS have protested at their planned resettlement to a site without basic services and 20 kilometres from the capital, where they would have no means of income and would lose access to medical treatment."
