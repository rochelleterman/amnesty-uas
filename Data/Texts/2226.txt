 South Africa (Bophuthatswana): Fear of extrajudicial execution: Solomon (Solly) Bokaba | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Solomon (Solly) Bokaba, aged 27, President of the Students Representative Council (SRC), received death threats and was seriously assaulted by Bophuthatswana police on 7 May 1993, following a move by police on the University of Bophuthatswana (UNIBO) campus to prevent students holding a march. While student, staff representatives and police officers were negotiating, police suddenly and without warning opened fire with rubber bullets and teargas and assaulted the unarmed and peaceful students with rubber batons. Eye-witnesses report that Solly Bokaba appeared to be singled out for assault. Many other students were injured, including Gloria Sekamoeng and Tsepo Mofokeng. They are currently receiving medical treatment in a Johannesburg hospital."
