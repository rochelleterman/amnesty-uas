 The three men named above from Shunde in Guangdong province were arrested by police on 6 April 1993 at Guangzhou airport, for allegedly trying to distribute handbills calling for greater democracy. Li Guoheng, a 31-year- old trader, is believed to be in very poor health after reportedly being beaten by prison guards. All three men have been denied visits by their relatives. They are reportedly being held in Shunde Detention Centre Prison No 14, south of Guangzhou City, but the authorities have not officially charged them, nor have they provided any information on the arrests.
