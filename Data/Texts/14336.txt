 There are grave fears for the safety of Fikri Ozgen, a 73-year-old Kurd, who is believed to be in detention at the Gendarmerie Headquarters in Diyarbakir. He is said to have been detained by four armed men, believed to be plainclothes police officers, on 27 February 1997. However, the authorities have so far failed to acknowledge that is in their custody.
