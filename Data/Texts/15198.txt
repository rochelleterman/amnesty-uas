 Turkey: Hunger-strike: Political prisoners in some 41 Turkish prisons | Amnesty International 
 Six political prisoners engaged in an indefinite hunger-strike in Turkey have died since 21 July 1996 and more than 250 others, on the 67th day of their protest, are in a critical condition with at least 20 reported to be close to death. Some of the prisoners' demands - for example, that ill-treatment and obstruction of medical treatment be stopped - coincide with concerns repeatedly raised with the Turkish authorities by AI.
