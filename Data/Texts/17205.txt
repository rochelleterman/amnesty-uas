 Hossein Dowlatkhah, a businessman, was sentenced to death on 18 June 1997 by a revolutionary court in Tehran on charges of corruption and embezzlement. He was also given a sentence of flogging after being accused of organizing ""lavish parties"" with drugs. There is concern that his appeal to the Supreme Court has been rejected.
