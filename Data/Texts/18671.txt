 Syria: Further information on  prisoner of conscience /   Unfair Trial/ Ill-Health / Ill-treatment. | Amnesty International 
 Eight named detainees have now been tried and sentenced   to prison terms, either by the Supreme State Security     Court (SSSC) or the Criminal Court. One of the men has    allegedly been ill-treated in prison. Amnesty             International considers their trials to be grossly unfair and calls for their immediate release as prisoners of     conscience held solely for the peaceful expression of     their political opinion.
