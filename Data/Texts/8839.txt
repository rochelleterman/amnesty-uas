 According to recent information issued by Gary Graham's lawyers, he was convicted of capital murder based solely on the identification testimony of a single witness. The courts have refused to consider evidence that he was with four other people at the time of the murder. Statistics relating to juvenile offenders on death row reveal that racial bias may have played a part in the outcome of Graham's trial. Graham has gone on hunger strike in Huntsville prison and reportedly intends to fast until his execution date. "
