 Nepal: Further Information on fear for safety/ possible ""disappearance"". Maina Sunuwar (f) | Amnesty International 
 Maina Sunuwar, who had been arrested by plainclothes security forces personnel in February 2004, is now known to have died in custody shortly after her arrest, allegedly as a result of torture. A court martial which looked into the circumstances around her arrest and death in custody ruled on 27 September 2005 that three army officers, had not followed the ""right procedure"" .The three were sentenced to six months' imprisonment and a fine. They were released immediately, on the grounds that the time they had spent consigned to barracks while awaiting trial should count towards their sentence.
