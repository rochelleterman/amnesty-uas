 Russia (Chechen Republic): Further information on appeal for the respect of humanitarian law: Parliament votes to introduce death penalty for ""illegal armed formations"" | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 20 January 1995, the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, voted to introduce a new article in the Criminal Code, punishing the ""organization of or participation in illegal armed formations"". The current wording of the new article imposes a sentence of up to eight years for such action and a possible death sentence if this is accompanied by ""mass violence, the death of people or other serious damage"". Those fighting Russian troops in the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic are frequently referred to as ""illegal armed formations""."
