 Gendun Rinchen and Lobsang Yonten, two Tibetan human rights monitors arrested in May 1993 and charged with ""stealing state secrets"" and engaging in ""separatist activities"", have been unexpectedly released, according to official sources in Lhasa. They were apparently not ill-treated and are reportedly in reasonable health. Damchoe Pemo was released in 1993; there is no further information about Lobsang Gyaltsen and Tashi Topgyal."
