 Amador Blanco Hernandez and Joel Mesa Morales have been sentenced to eight and seven years' imprisonment respectively on charges of ""enemy propoganda"" on 3 September at the Villa Clara People's Provincial Tribunal. They are prisoners of conscience. According to unofficial reports of the trial, their lawyer was prevented from presenting witnesses. Jorge Luis Alvarez Antunes, aged about 20, was called as a witness for the prosecution. He is a political prisoner serving a ten-year sentence, also for ""enemy propaganda"", and may also be a prisoner of conscience. It is reported that from the witness box he made allegations that he had been tortured, and there are fears that he may suffer reprisals. "
