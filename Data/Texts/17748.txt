 Israel/Lebanon: Civilian killings/Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 At least 10 people, including civilians, have been        killed, and dozens wounded, across Lebanon and northern   Israel over the last 24 hours as hostilities have         escalated between Israel and armed groups opposed to the  Israeli occupation of a ""security zone"" in south Lebanon. Eight of those killed in Israeli air raids were Lebanese, including civil defence workers and civilians. Two        Israeli civilians died in Hizbullah shelling of the town  of Qiryat Shemona in northen Israel. Amnesty              International is concerned the this escalation may        continue and result in more civilian casualties.
