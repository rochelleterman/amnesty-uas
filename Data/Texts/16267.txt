 UA 203/93 - Uzbekistan: fear of imminent execution: Venera Kasymova | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Veneral Kasymova, the mother of two small children, faces imminent execution after having been sentenced to death. The limited information currently available about her case suggests that an appeal against her sentence to the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan has been turned down, in which case her only avenue left is a petition for clemency to the President of Uzbekistan. No information is currently available about the crime for which she was convicted, nor about where or when her trial took place "
