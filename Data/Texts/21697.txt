 NA 
 The authorities in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, are preparing to carry out forced eviction of a Roma community living in an informal settlement in an area known as Belvil. At least 300 households will be demolished to make way for a new road. The families could be left homeless as a result of the evictions, which are due to start within days. "
