 Algeria: Further information on secret detention/fear of torture/medical concern: Abderhamane Mehalli (m) | Amnesty International 
 Abderhamane Mehalli was brought before a judge in the capital, Algiers, on 6 January and charged with belonging to a terrorist group and failing to denounce a criminal to the authorities. The charges appear to arise from his supposedly having contact with his brother, Bedrane, who joined an Islamist armed group in 1993. After the court hearing he was taken to Serkadji prison, Algiers. In prison he is in far less immediate danger of ill-treatment or torture.
