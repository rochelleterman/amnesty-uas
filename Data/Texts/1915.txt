 Rwanda: Fear for safety / fear of ill-treatment / arbitrary arrest / possible extrajudicial execution and new concern: possible prisoner of conscience: Amiel Nkuriza | Amnesty International 
 Amiel Nkuriza, director of Intego and editor of Le Partisan, Appolos Hakizimana, journalist at Intego, Isaie Niyoyita, editor of Intego: Two journalists with the independent weekly newspaper Intego are in detention in Kigali, where Amnesty International fears they may be ill-treated. The organization is concerned that they appear to have been detained simply because of the peaceful expression of their opinions and because Intego is perceived as critical of the government. Isaie Niyoyita is reported to have gone into hiding following the arrests of his colleagues.
