 Equatorial Guinea: Prison conditions / health concern | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is very concerned about the health  of scores of Bubi prisoners, including Emilio Ribas       Esada, Gregorio Bomuagasi, Milagrosa Cheba (f),           Alejandro Mbe Bita Rope and approximately 80 others       prisoners convicted in May 1998. They are being held in   appalling conditions in Malabo prison.  Eleven have been  held in incommunicado detention since May 1998.  On 20    October 1999, a detainee in the prison, Digno Sepa        Tobachi, ""Elako"", died as a result of torture and lack of medical care.
