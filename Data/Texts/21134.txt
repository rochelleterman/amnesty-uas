 At approximately 1pm on 9 September, Sanjeev Kumar was released from Kamunting Detention Centre where he had been detained under the Internal Security Act for more than a year.  The government had accused him of being a foreign spy, but was not formally charged in court.  He was tortured and suffered other ill-treatment whilst in detention. Having been paralyzed on his left hand side he is now confined to a wheelchair. Sanjeev Kumar is presently at home with his family, but remains under surveillance. "
