 UA 114/94 - South Africa: torture / health concern: Michael Mathe | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is serious concern for the physical and mental well-being of Michael Mathe, aged 16, who is currently in custody at Alberton Police Station, East Rand. He was arrested on 9 January 1994 in Katlehong, East Rand, by officers of the Internal Stability Unit (ISU) of the South African Police (SAP), after senior ANC and South African Communist Party (SACP) officials and journalists were fired upon by gunmen. Michael Mathe is a member of a local self-defence unit (SDU). Between 9 to 11 January he was transferred to Nyoni Farm police base where he was allegedly repeatedly assaulted by police. He appears to have been seriously affected by this torture, and those visiting him have expressed concern at his deteriorating mental state. He was remanded to Boksburg Prison in late January, but has since been transferred back into police custody."
