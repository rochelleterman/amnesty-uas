 On 22 April 2002, the US Supreme Court announced that it would hear the appeal of Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman. Shortly before he had been due to be put to death on 10 April, the Court had issued a stay, in order to give it more time to decide whether to take his case. If the Court had decided not to do so, the state would have moved to execute him.
