 Kurdish lawyer Faik Candan has not been seen since 2 December 1994. Relatives making inquiries at the Anti-Terror Branch of Ankara Police Headquarters were allegedly told that he was a dangerous man who had ""contacts with the outlawed terror organization"" and were told not to ask for him again. Faik Candan, a member of the Ankara Bar Association, was president of the Ankara Branch of the People's Labour Party (HEP), which was closed down by the Constitution Court in July 1993 for ""separatism"""
