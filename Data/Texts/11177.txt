 UA 201/94 - India: unacknowledged detention / fear of ""disappearance"": Sukhwinder Singh Bhatti | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Sukhwinder Singh Bhatti has not been seen since he was abducted by armed men from a bus travelling to his home village of Badbar on 12 May 1994. Reports from Punjab suggest that the police are responsible, and that he is being held in unacknowledged police custody. A habeas corpus petition was heard at Chandigarh High Court on 23 May, the outcome of which is unknown."
