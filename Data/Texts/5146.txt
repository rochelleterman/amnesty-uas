 AI is deeply concerned for the safety of civilians in the municipality of Buga since the killing on 14 August 1994 of the three men named above. The men appear to have been killed by a paramilitary group which may be acting with the cooperation of the Colombian armed forces. During there was a power cut and no telephone lines were available. The name ""COLSIGUE"" (""Colombia without guerrillas"") was found graffitied on walls next to the scene of the attack. COLSIGUE is the acronym of a recently formed paramilitary group."
