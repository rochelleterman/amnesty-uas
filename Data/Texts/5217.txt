 UA 393/92 - Colombia: fear of ""disappearance"" / fear of torture: Edgar Antonio Alvarez Martinez, Jairo Alfonso Acuna | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Edgar Antonio Alvarez Martinez and Jairo Alfonso Acuna, both mechanics and activists in the legal left-wing party M-19 Democratic Alliance, have not been seen since 9 December 1992, when witnesses saw them being detained by armed men in Giron, near Bucaramanga, Santander department. The local human rights ombudsman has attempted to locate them but inquiries to local police and military authorities as well as to hospitals and morgues have yielded no trace of the two. Edgar Alvarez had recently moved to Giron from Barrancabermeja because of death threats and harassment. There is grave concern about their physical safety. "
