 Iran: Amputation: Six people (names unknown) | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is gravely concerned at Iranian newspaper reports that six people convicted more than once of theft have had their fingers amputated. There are fears that others may be at imminent risk of this judicial punishment. The amputations were reportedly carried out before other convicted thieves.
