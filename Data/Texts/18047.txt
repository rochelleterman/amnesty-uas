 Eleven of the detainees whose cases have been referred to a military investigating judge have reportedly been charged in connection with the distribution of leaflets. Jose 'Afif has reportedly been charged also with unauthorized entry into enemy territory and unauthorized commercial contact with enemy nationals or residents. Four of the eleven are still held: Emile al-Hachem, Nu'man Antoine, Mansour Sfeir and Jose 'Afif, who remains under guard in hospital. AI does not have information about others reportedly arrested in connection with the same event. AI is also concerned about continuing allegations that some detainees were tortured or ill-treated. "
