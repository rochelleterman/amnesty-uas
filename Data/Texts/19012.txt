 Tunisia: Prisoners of conscience / medical concern: Tahar Gargoura, Ridha Errasas, Zine Essaid | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The three students named above were sentenced on 18 January 1995 to six months' imprisonment on charges of belonging to an unauthorized organization, the Parti Communiste des Ouvriers Tunisiens, PCOT. Their appeal is to take place shortly. AI believes them to be prisoners of conscience, imprisoned solely for thier suspected association with an illegal party which does not use or advocate violence. AI is also concerned that Tahar Gargoura suffers from tubercolosis and Ridha Errasas has a skin disease, conditions not helped by unhygenic conditions of detention and inadequate medical care. AI is calling for their unconditional release."
