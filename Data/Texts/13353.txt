 Johannes van Damme, a Dutch national aged 59, is scheduled to be executed on 23 September 1994. He was arrested on 27 September 1991 and convicted of trafficking in heroin. The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected his appeal on 23 November 1993. His only hope of clemency now lies with President Ong Teng Cheong."
