 Brazil: possible extrajudicial executions / fear for safety / medical concern: Squatter peasants in Corumbiara, Rondonia State | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A confrontation on 9 August between Rondonia state military police and a group of 500 squatter peasant (posseiro) families is reported to have left at least 11 peasants, including two children, and two policemen dead and over 100 people wounded. The full death toll is not known but reports indicate it could be considerably higher. There is serious concern for some of the gravely wounded whose whereabouts are unknown, and other peasants who remain unaccounted for. It is not clear if the police or the peasants initiated the confrontation, but reports indicate that once inside the encampment police began to fire indiscriminately. Some 450 peasants were arrested, although by the end of 10 August police reportedly began releasing detainees."
