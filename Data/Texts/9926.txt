 USA: Fear of forcible return / Fear of torture / Fear of  execution | Amnesty International 
 The US authorities may be preparing to release more than 100 detainees from the US naval base in Guant‡namo Bay in Cuba. While Amnesty International has been calling for, and would welcome, releases of detainees from the base, it is concerned that some detainees may face serious human rights abuses, including torture and execution, if returned to their countries. Among those at risk is an unknown number of Uighurs facing possible return to China.
