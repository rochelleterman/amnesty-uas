 USA (Texas):  Death penalty / Legal concern  Victor Hugo Salda√±o (m), Argentine national, aged 29 | Amnesty International 
 Victor Salda–o remains on death row in Texas despite the state Attorney General's attempts to have his death sentence overturned because of the introduction of racially discriminatory testimony at his 1996 trial. The District Attorney of the county where the trial was held is seeking, so far successfully, to have the death sentence upheld in the courts.
