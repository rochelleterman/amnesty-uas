 Another five lawyers have been detained in a police operation which has been taking place since mid-November 1993. There are now 16 defence lawyers in detention, reportedly on the basis of statements given to the police by a political prisoner in Diyarbakir Prison who became a police informer. The detained lawyers continue to be held incommunicado."
