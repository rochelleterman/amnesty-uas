 Iran: Rights defenders pressured to ""confess"" | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Seven members of an Iranian human rights organization, the Committee of Human Rights Reporters, are being held in detention in Tehran. They are under pressure to ""confess"" to links with a banned opposition group, in which case they might face charges which can carry the death penalty. Three of the seven were among those arrested on a bus on its way to the funeral of a dissident cleric in December."
