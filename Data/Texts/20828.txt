 China: North Koreans facing forcible return | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Chinese authorities are preparing to forcibly return at least 21 people to North Korea, where they would be at serious risk of torture and other ill-treatment, forced labour and death.  Any attempt to return them to North Korea, where they are at risk of grave human rights violations is against customary international law. "
