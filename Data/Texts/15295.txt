 NA 
 Gulay Toraman, wife of Huseyin Toraman who ""disappeared"" in police detention in Istanbul in October 1991, was arrested in Izmir on 12 December 1992. She has reportedly been transferred to the Anti-Terror Branch of Kocaeli Police Headquarters for interrogation. She was detained ostensibly on the basis of an old arrest warrant after a meeting to mark Human Rights Day at which she had given a speech. The Izmir prosecutor has informed her lawyers that she may be held for 15 days. Gulay Toraman has been campaigning for information about the fate of her ""disappeared"" husband; she has been arrested on two previous occasions in recent months. AI fears that she may be tortured during interrogation. "
