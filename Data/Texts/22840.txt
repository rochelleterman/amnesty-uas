 Syria: Medical Action: Health concern: six imprisoned human rights defenders | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International (AI) is concerned about the health  of Mamun al-Humsi, Riad Seif, 'Aref Dalilah, Muhammad     Ra'dun, Nizar Ristnawi, and Mas'oud Hamid, human rights   defenders and prisoners of conscience in Syria. In        addition to their imprisonment solely on the basis of the peaceful expression of their beliefs, the organization    has concerns about hunger-strikes; incommunicado          detention; and lack of medical treatment. AI calls for    the immediate and unconditional release of the six men    named above, for access to appropriate medical care where needed and an end to the practice of incommunicado        detention."
