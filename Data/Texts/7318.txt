 Manuel Manriquez San Agustin, a musician from the Otomi indigenous community of Rancheria Piedra Blanca, Tutotepec, state of Hidaldo has been on a dry hunger-strike since 15 August 1994 and is said to be in a critical condition. He was arbitrarily arrested by the Federal District's judicial police in Mexico City on 2 June 1990. After being severely tortured and ill-treated in incommunicado detention he was forced to sign papers he did not understand. He was sentenced to 24 years' imprisonment in July 1991 accused of murder on the basis of his ""signed confession"". He is a prisoner of conscience."
