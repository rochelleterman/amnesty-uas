 Human rights activist Yang Chunlin (m) was tried by the Jiamusi City Intermediate People's Court in Heilongjiang Province on 19 February 2008. Previous reports of abuse in detention and his treatment during the trial suggest that he continues to be subjected to torture or other ill-treatment. He was tried on charges of ‘inciting subversion of state power’. He pleaded not guilty, but the verdict has yet to be announced."
