 There is grave concern for the safety of the five men named above who have ""disappeared"" following their detention on 13 May 1994. Gendarmes raided the village of Esenli in the province of Diyarbakir and apparently burned it to the ground. The five men were detained during this incident. Lice Gendarmerie Headquarters has verbally denied holding the men and no reply has been received to inquiries made to the provincial and local governors' offices or to Lice Police Headquarters."
