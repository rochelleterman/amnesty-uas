 Iran: Further Information on ""Disappearance"" / torture / ill-treatment, Manuchehr Mohammadi | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of Simin Mohammadi, who is reportedly being held in solitary confinement at Evin prison, in the capital Tehran. She does not have access to a lawyer, and may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Amnesty International fears that Simin Mohammadi may have been detained solely because she is the sister of student activist Manuchehr Mohammadi, who has been in prison since 1999.
