 UA 412/93 - South Africa: ""disappearance"" / fear for physical safety: Clare Stewart | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Clare Stewart, a 34-year-old agricultural development worker and African National Congress (ANC) member was abducted on 10 November in northern Natal. The day before her ""disappearance"" a number of men, apparently speaking a Mozambican dialect, were seen in her home area making explicit inquiries about her. The area where she lives and works is a security sensitive area because of its proximity to the border with Mozambique and the scale of weapons smuggling into South Africa. There is concern that one of the police officers investigating her case is also the subject of litigation by trade unionist Sipho Cele, her former partner. He is currently involved in a civil damages suit against the police for unlawful arrest and assault."
