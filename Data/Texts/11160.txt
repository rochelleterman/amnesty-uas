 Hamida Mattoo, a 35-year-old woman from Baramulla, was reportedly killed by members of the security forces who opened fire in her village on 3 March 1993. This attack was apparently in retaliation for an attack earlier that day by armed militants. AI is concerned about evidence of a growing pattern of killings of unarmed civilians by the security forces in Kashmir. "
