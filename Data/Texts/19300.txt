 Qursan Ahsan Qursan, 'Abdullah Mohamed Saliha, 'Ali 'Abdulla Tahoos and Ibrahim al-Huthi are among at least 50 people detained following clashes between security forces members of the Shi'a Zaidi community in Sa'da in northern of Yemen, at the end of January. The detainees are reportedly held incommunicado in undisclosed locations. Amnesty International is concerned that they are at risk of torture and ill-treatment and that many of them may be prisoners of conscience, held solely for expressing their conscientiously-held beliefs.
