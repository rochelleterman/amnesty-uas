"Jordan: Death penalty 
 Jordan: Death penalty | Amnesty International 
 The four men were sentenced to death on 19 August. The judgement is ""irreversible"", and no appeal can be made against it. Now the men's only hope is the King, who still has the power to overturn the sentences, which have been sent to him for ratification; if he approves the sentences they may be executed at any time.
