 Sayed Ali Akbar Mousavi-Kho'ini, a former student leader, former member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly, the Majles (Iran's parliament) and current Head of the Alumni Association of Iran (Sazman-e Danesh Amukhtegan-e Iran-e Eslami [Advar-e Tahkim-e Vahdat]), has reportedly been ill-treated in detention. He is held in Section 209 of Evin Prison, which is run by the Ministry of Intelligence. Amnesty International believes him to be a prisoner of conscience, held solely on account of the peaceful exercise of his internationally recognized right to freedom of expression and association.
