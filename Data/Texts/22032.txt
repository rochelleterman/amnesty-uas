 Iran: Further information on possible prisoner of conscience: Roxana Saberi (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Roxana Saberi was brought before a Revolutionary Court in Tehran on 13 April 2009 and charged with espionage, in proceedings that took place behind closed doors. She appears to be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of expression in the course of her work as a journalist. The charge of espionage appears to be politically motivated, and she appears to have been targeted because of her US nationality."
