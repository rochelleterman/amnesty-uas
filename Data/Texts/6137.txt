 Guatemala: fear of ""disappearance"": Alexander Yovani Gomez Virula | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Alexander Yovani Gomez, financial secretary of the Sindicato de Trabajadores de la Empresa RCA (RCA factory workers' union), was last seen at about 7.30pm on 13 March 1995, about 800 metres from his home in Guatemala City. His family has been unable to find him. It is feared that he has been abducted in connection with his trade union activities. His union is involved in a sit-in protest at the RCA factory, which closed in August 1994. The workers claim that the owners closed the factory to destroy the union."
