 Prisoner of conscience Rachida Ben Salem, a mother of two, and the wife of a supporter of an Islamist group, was transferred on 31 May from the Ministry of the Interior, where she had been held incommunicado, to Mannouba women's prison. She was brought before a judge on 2 June and reportedly charged, together with at least five other individuals, with belonging to an armed gang. She was reportedly not ill-treated during her incommunicado detention, but was allegedly insulted and ill-treated during interrogation in two police stations following her arrest.
