 EXTRA 44/94 - USA (Texas): death penalty: Cesar R Fierro | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Cesar Fierro, a Mexican national, was sentenced to death in 1980 for the murder of a white taxi-driver. He is due to be executed on 10 August 1994. Cesar Fierro was convicted on the testimony of an allegedly mentally impaired juvenile and his own confession, which was obtained under duress. His lawyers claim that no evidence linking him to the trial was presented at trial. AI fears that he may proceed despite new evidence to suggest that important information relating to his confession was supressed by police at trial."
