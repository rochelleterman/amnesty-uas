 NA 
 Senator Raul Roco, Justice Francis Garchitorena, Justice Jose Balajadia; and human rights lawyers: Jose Manuel Diokno, Efren Moncupa, Arno Sanidad, Alexander Padilla, Theodore Te, Lorenzo Tanada, Wigberto Tanada, Francis Pangilinan: On 31 January 1997 Senator Raul Roco, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Human Rights and Social Justice, received a death threat letter. Copies of the letter were also sent to two judges, and threatened several lawyers, mainly from the human rights NGO Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG). The tone, contents and choice of recipients strongly suggests that the authors were members of the Philippine National Police (PNP) seeking to threaten those involved in the continuing prosecution of 27 PNP officers involved in alleged extrajudicial executions.
