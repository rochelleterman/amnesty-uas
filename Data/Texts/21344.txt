 The Swedish authorities are once again preparing to deport asylum-seeker Jamil Burhan to Eritrea, where he would be at risk of being detained and tortured. According to his lawyers, the Eritrean embassy in Sweden has now issued the necessary travel documents to allow Jamil Burhan to be sent to Eritrea. His lawyers fear that the deportation could go ahead as early as 15 April 2008."
