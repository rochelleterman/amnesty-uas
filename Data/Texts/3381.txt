 Democratic Republic of Congo: Fear of imminent execution / legal concern: Muderwa, 15 year old boy soldier | Amnesty International 
 On 28 March Muderwa, a member of the presidential guard, was sentenced to death by a military tribunal after a grossly unfair trial and is now under threat of imminent execution. The military court's statute prohibits appeal to a higher jurisdiction and defendants have no opportunity to challenge convictions and sentences handed down by the court.  Only President Kabila has the power to commute the sentences.
