It is unclear whether he has been allowed access to a lawyer or whether he has been formally charged with any recognizably criminal offence. There is no further news of Bhim Giri and Bhai Kaji Ghimire who were reportedly arrested from the Chhetrapati area of Kathmandu by security force personnel on December 3rd 2003.
