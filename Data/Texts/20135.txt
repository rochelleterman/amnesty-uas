 Haiti: Convicted human rights abusers must not be allowed to walk free | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 This web action urges the Governments of United States, France and Canada to take practical measures to end the   cycle of impunity in Haiti. In particular to ensure that  convicted human rights abusers, including rebel leaders   Louis Jodel Chamblain and Jean Pierre Baptiste (""Jean     Tatoune""), are not be allowed to take positions of        authority where they might commit further human rights    violations, but taken into custody and brought before the Haiti justice system."
