 In late August, 18 members of the security forces and seven civilian informants suspected of being responsible for the ""disppearance"", torture and killing of at least 21 people were arrested. Ten of those arrested are members of the Special Task Force (STF) an elite police commando unit. There are also reports that the head of the STF has been suspended by President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. Thirteen of the victims found have been identified as Tamils. It is not yet known whether the above are among the 13 victims identified."
