 UA 152/93 - Rwanda: fear of extrajudicial execution: Ignace Ruhatana, Sylvestre Kamali | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Ignace Ruhatana and Sylvestre Kamali, who have been subjected to attacks and death threats in recent weeks. Those responsible are thought to be members of the security forces and pro- government vigilante groups from the majority Hutu ethnic group, targeting people suspected or known to support equal rights for the minority Tutsi ethnic group. On the night of 3 May 1993 in Kigali, Ignace Ruhatana, a leading member of the human rights organization, ""KANYARWANDA"", was attacked at home with his family. Sylvestre Kamali, Gisenyi prefecture's president of the opposition Mouvement Democratique Republicain (MDR), has also received threats and attempts on his life, including a recent attack on the night watchman guarding his house.
