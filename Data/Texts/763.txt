 Ethiopia: Fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Teachers and students were arrested after demonstrations  against the Oromia regional government in  western        Ethiopia, where police have beaten and shot               demonstrators. They are now held incommunicado, without   charge. Amnesty International is concerned that they may  have been arrested for the non-violent expression of      their opinions and it fears they may be tortured or       ill-treated.
