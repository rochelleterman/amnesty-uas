 The head of the armed forces, Issa Massou, assured participants in UA 275/92 that the detainees named above were being well looked after and were being investigated. However, AI remains concerned that those named above, arrested between 27 and 31 August 1992, are among at least 100 people of Tuareg origin still detained outside any legal framework on account of their alleged connections with the Tuareg rebel movement.
