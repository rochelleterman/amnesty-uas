 Thailand: Fear of forcible return/arbitrary arrest | Amnesty International 
 The Thai authorities are reportedly preparing to forcibly return 16 Lao Hmong asylum-seekers. The 16 had recently fled because of alleged serious persecution by the Lao authorities. No international human rights organisations would have access to them in Laos, and they would be in danger of serious human rights violations, including torture.
