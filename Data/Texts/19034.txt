 Tunisia: Fear for safety: Radhia Nasraoui | Amnesty International 
 On the night of 11-12 February 1998 the office of Radhia Nasraoui, human rights lawyer and mother of two children, was ransacked following a period of increasingly intense harassment and surveillance by security forces.  Amnesty International is extremely concerned for her and her family's safety.
