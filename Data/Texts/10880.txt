 Fu Shenqi's hearing against his three-year administrative detention sentence was held on 12 november 1993. He and his wife were allowed to attend and he himself was permitted to speak. However, his solicitors were not able to present their whole testimony and were not allowed to call any witnesses. The decision on the hearing will apparently be made within the next three months."
