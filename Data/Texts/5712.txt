 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Cecilia Guijarro, who according to reports, has been threatened by officials said to be working for the Ministry of Defence. The threats reportedly were made on 8 September 1993, the day after a demonstration in front of the Ministry of Defence, protesting the possible ""disappearance"" of her eldest son, Nixon Algides Pacheco Guijarro, on 16 January. During the demonstration she made statements to the radio and television, holding the army responsible for her son's alleged ""disappearance"". She and her three younger children have also been followed on several occasions. "
