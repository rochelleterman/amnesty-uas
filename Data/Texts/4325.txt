 There is grave concern for the safety of Rodrigo Rodriguez Sierra, a leader of the olive-oil producers' union, who was abducted on 16 February 1995 from a hotel in Barranquilla by armed men who identified themselves as being from the security forces. A writ of habeas corpus was submitted on 17 February but all efforts to locate him have been unsuccessful."
