 Brazil's caveir達o: ""What are you most afraid of?"" | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The caveir達o (""big skull"") is a military-style assault vehicle used to police Rio de Janeiro's favelas. It       targets socially excluded communities, increasing         violence and criminalizing poverty. Between May and       September 2005, 11 people were killed in caveir達o-led     operations. The caveir達o is part of a pattern of          confrontational and intimidating policing. It targets     socially excluded communities, increasing violence and    criminalizing poverty in Rio."
