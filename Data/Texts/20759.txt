 Afghanistan: Death penalty | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Supreme Court of Afghanistan has upheld around 100 death sentences issued by lower courts against individuals convicted of crimes including murder, rape, kidnapping and armed robbery.  The sentences require the approval of President Karzai before executions can be carried out.  Amnesty International fears that sudden and large-scale executions may take place in secrecy as happened in October 2007. "
