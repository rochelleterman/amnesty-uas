 There is concern at reports that 48 people have been extrajudicially executed by members of the Togolese army (FAT). The killings followed an alleged attempt to overthrow the government on 5 January 1994. There is fear for the safety of many others taken into detention at the same time. The 12 soldiers named above, who are believed to have been among those killed on 6 January, had been arrested in connection with an alleged attack on 25 March 1993, and had been detained since then at the headquarters of the Combined Forces Regiment (RIT)."
