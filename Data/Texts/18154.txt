 Fawzia 'Abdullah Gogha, the wife of Fathi al-Jahmi, was released from detention on 4 November. However, Fathi al-Jahmi remains in detention at an undisclosed location. It is feared that he is being held in solitary confinement by the Internal Security. Reports indicate that his health may be further deteriorating, at least partly as a result of continuing to be denied adequate medical treatment.
