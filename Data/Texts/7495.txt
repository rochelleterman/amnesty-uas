 Mexico: Torture / Unfair trial/ Death threats | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that 60 detainees from Loxicha region, Oaxaca state, may be sentenced to         imprisonment on the basis of confessions reported to have been extracted under torture. On 7 July nine prisoners,   Benito ALMARAZ ENRêQUEZ, Jord‡n ALMARAZ SILVA, Arnulfo    ALMARAZ VALENCIA, Eleno HERNçNDEZ ALMARAZ, Genaro LîPEZ   RUIZ, Jos_ PACHECO CONTRERAS, Guillermo PACHECO PACHECO,  Silvano PACHECO PACHECO, and Agust’n PACHECO HERNçNDEZ,   all from the same region, were each    sentenced to 40    years imprisonment after an unfair        judicial        process which apparently included the use of              confessions extracted under torture. The defence is       lodging an immediate appeal.
