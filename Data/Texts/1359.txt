 Edmond Jika and Gabriel Nkunika were arrested on 24 February 1993, on their return to Malawi from exile in Zambia to campaign for multi-party democracy in the 14 June referendum. After being held for several weeks, Edmond Jika was released on bail in mid-April, but it is not known what charges have been brought against him, or whether he will stand trial. Gabriel Nkunika was deported back to Zambia in mid-March. "
