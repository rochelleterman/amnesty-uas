 Tunisia: Further information on possible prisoner of conscience / torture / health concern: Bachir Abid | Amnesty International 
 Bachir Abid, a member of the executive bureau of the Union generale des etudiants tunisiens (UGET), was acquitted by the Court of the First Instance in Sfax on 2 April 1997 and is at liberty. There remains concern that no investigation has been carried out into his allegations that he was tortured during a period of secret detention in November 1995.
