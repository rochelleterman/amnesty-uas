 Presidento Alfredo Cristiani and other government officials have claimed that investigations into the case of Eleno Hernan Casto have been concluded, and had revealed that it was not a politically motivated killing. However the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador (ONUSAL) has confirmed that the investigation is still open, and that no conclusion can yet be drawn."
