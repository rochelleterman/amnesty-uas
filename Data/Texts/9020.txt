 USA (Oklahoma): Further information on Death penalty / Legal concern, Jimmie Ray Slaughter
 | Amnesty International 
 At a clemency hearing on 15 February, the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-0 not to recommend clemency for Jimmie Slaughter. In Oklahoma, the governor can only commute a death sentence with a recommendation to do so from the Board. However, the governor can issue a temporary reprieve and request that the board reconsider its decision.
