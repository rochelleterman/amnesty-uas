"Iran: Prisoners of conscience / death penalty 
 NA 
 Dhabihullah Mahrami, Musa Talibi: There is grave concern that these two men may be at risk of imminent execution following reports that the Supreme Court has confirmed their death sentences. They are both Baha'is, a religious minority not recognized in Iran, and have been sentenced to death for apostasy. Both are accused of having converted to Islam in the past and then having reverted to the Baha'i religion. Amnesty International believes that they are prisoners of conscience and is calling for the death sentences against them to be lifted and for them to be released immediately and unconditionally.
