 Kemal Yazar was detained in Izmir on 1 January 1993. He was reportedly detained at Izmir airport when he was found travelling with a false passport. It is thought that he may have been transferred to the Anti- Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters. Kemal Yazar was previously detained in Istanbul in 1990 and charged with membership of an armed gang; he was allegedly tortured while in detention. It is feared that he may be subjected to torture again while under interrogation."
