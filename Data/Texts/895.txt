 The above, who were among about 500 arrested on 20 September 1994 at the Central High Court in Addis Ababa, were all taken to court in early October and have now been released on bail. No date has been set for the trials. After nearly a month in custody, about 250 people were freed unconditionally, while 247 others have been charged with holding an illegal demonstration and contempt of court. The latter were all granted bail, although only about 80 could afford bail and were released. No date has been set for the trials, in which defendants could be jailed for up to six months and/or fined, if convicted."
