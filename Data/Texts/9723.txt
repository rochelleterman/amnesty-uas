 USA: Legal concern/health concern/torture: Unknown number of GuantÃ¡namo detainees

 | Amnesty International 
 An unknown number of detainees at the US prison camp in Guantænamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, have reportedly been on hunger strike since around 7 July, in protest at the conditions in the camp, which amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and the fact that they cannot challenge their detention through the courts. Amnesty International considers the detention of all the inmates at Guantænamo Bay to be unlawful and arbitrary.
