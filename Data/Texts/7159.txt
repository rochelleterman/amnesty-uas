 Jamaica: Death threats: Errol Reid
 | Amnesty International 
 Errol Reid, an eyewitness to the killing of a street vendor by Jamaican police, has received over twenty death threats. Amnesty International fears that these threats are part of a deliberate strategy to prevent him from testifying at the inquest into the killing of the vendor, Basil Brown, in February 2003.
