 Vu Hung, a teacher held in pre-trial detention since 18 September 2008, has not been seen since he was moved from his cell in B14 prison, Ha Noi, two months ago. His health had deteriorated after reportedly being beaten during several interrogation sessions, and starting a hunger-strike in protest at his treatment. "
