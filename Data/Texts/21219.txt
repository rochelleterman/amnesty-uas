 Sri Lanka: Student fears for safety after death threats: D.M. Thushara Jayaratne | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A Sri Lankan student who complained that his law school's final exams were being managed unfairly was abducted, interrogated and threatened with death before being released. On 4 March 2011 he was abducted and questioned about complaints he had made against the Law College Registrar before being released nearly 12 hours later. On 7 March 2011, Thushara filed a complaint about his abduction and threats with the Inspector General of police and the Human Rights Commission (HRC), but the HRC refused to pursue the case."
