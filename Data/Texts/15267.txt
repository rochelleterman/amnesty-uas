 AI has learnt that Celal Meral, Ziya Ulusoy and Mehmet Ustundag, previously thought ""disappeared"", were carrying false identity cards when they were arrested and were consequently registered under false names. All of the above detainees have reportedly been registered and may be held incommunicado for 15 days starting on 8 November 1992. "
