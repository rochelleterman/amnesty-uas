 Guinea-Bissau / Spain: Further information on: fear of refoulement / ill-treatment / fear for safety / health concern | Amnesty International 
 Albert Mukesha Batwaro, Rwandese, and from Guinea-Conakry: Souleymane Diallo, Sulaymane Souare, Alpha Makmadou Barry, Abubacar Sall, and other African nationals: On 23 August 1996 Albert Mukesha Batwaro and the 45 other people deported to Guinea-Bissau from Spain, ended their hunger-strike. Amnesty International remains concerned about the health and safety of the 46 African nationals, as one of the deportees has developed mental problems, another has kidney problems and some are suffering from malaria. Amnesty International fears that some of these people  may be at risk of serious human rights violations if they are returned to their countries.
