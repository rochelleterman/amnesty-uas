 Rwanda/Tanzania/Uganda: Further information on fear of refoulement: more than 500,000 Rwandese refugees in Tanzania | Amnesty International 
 Following the statement issued by the Tanzanian Government and the UNHCR that all Rwandese refugees in Tanzania were expected to return home by 31 December 1996, thousands of refugees have reportedly fled from the refugee camps. There is grave concern that these refugees have fled to areas of the country where they have no protection, and that they remain at risk of forcible repatriation.
