 EXTRA 62/93 - Turkey: ""disappearance"" / fear of torture: Engin Gumuscu, Medeni Ugurel, Vasfiye Sancar | Amnesty International

 On the evening of 24 June 1993 the three people named above were detained in the Baglar district of Diyarbakir. Later that evening Engin Gumuscu was brought to his house by plainclothes police officers, and then taken away again. When his family and the lawyers of all three detainees made representations on 25 June and again on 28 June, the prosecutor at Diyarbakir State Security Court replied that they had not been registered as being detained. Engin Gumuscu's younger brother claimed that he had heard his brother's voice at the Cevik Kuvvet (Mobile Force) Headquarters at the Police College outside Diyarbakir where he himself was detained for a time. There are fears that they may be subjected to torture while in incommunicado and unacknowledged detention. "
