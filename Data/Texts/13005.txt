 Pakistan: Legal concern/ enforced disappearance/ fear of torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Up to 485 victims of enforced disappearance were due to have their cases heard by the Pakistan Supreme Court on 13 November 2007. Following General Musharraf's declaration of the state of emergency, the former Chief   Justice and other senior judges were summarily dismissed. As a result, all hearings of cases of enforced            disappearance due to be heard are currently suspended.    The fate of those whose cases were due to be heard today, as well as hundreds of others who have gone missing,      remain unknown. They are at serious risk of torture and   other ill-treatment.
