 AI understands that at least 16 supporters of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) detained since mid-1994: Elijah Baadom, John Banatu, Kagbara Basseh, Israel Blessing, Friday Gburuma, Paul Deekor, Godwin Gbodoo, Adam Kaan, Bariture Lebee, Nyieda Nasikpo, Sampson Ntignee, Nwinbari Abere Papa, Pogbara Zorzor, Samuel Asigha, Barbina Visor, Benjamin Kabari and three others detained in October 1995: Taagalo Monsi, Baribuma Kumanwe, Ngbaa Baovi, have been charged with murder in connection with the May 1994 killings of four Ogoni leaders.  Due to be tried before a Special Civil Disturbances Tribunal outside the normal judicial process, AI fears that the 19 could be unfairly tried, sentenced to death and executed without right of appeal to a higher court."
