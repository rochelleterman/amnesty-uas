 Turkey: Fear of torture / possible prisoners of conscience: Huseyin Umit, Sukru Calli | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On the afternoon of 15 June 1995, lawyer and human rights activist Huseyin Umit was detained in a cafe in the centre of Hakkari. Later that day, in an apparently related operation, the former mayor of Hakkari, Sukru Calli, was also taken into detention. At 6pm, the files of the Hakkari branch of the HRA were removed from Huseyin Umut's office by police. AI believes that the two men may be prisoners of conscience and fears that they may be  at risk of ill-treatment or torture in incommunicado detention."
