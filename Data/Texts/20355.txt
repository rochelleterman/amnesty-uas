 NA 
 Three leaders of a protest in Mexico against high electricity bills were released from prison on 6 June, after 11 months. Sara López, Joaquín Aguilar and Guadalupe Borja, were released from the state prison of San Francisco Kobén in Campeche state. Their release occurred after a federal review court rejected the Federal Attorney General’s Office challenge to the January 2010 ruling by a federal appeal court that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them.
