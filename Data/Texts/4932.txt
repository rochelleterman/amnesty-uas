 There is further concern for the safety of peasant farmers and their leaders participating in a strike action in Ibague, department of Tolima. Carlos Ramirez was reportedly last seen in Ibague on 7 August surrounded by members of the security forces. On 8 August some 800 peasant farmers staged a sit-down protest after they were prevented from travelling from Planadas to Ibague. The army responded by firing tear-gas at and beating the protestors. Pedro Leon, president of the Communal Action Council, and 68-year-old Moises Garcia were seen being beaten, but their whereabouts are now unknown. Rafael Jimenez Moreno was beaten until he was unconscious and was subsequently detained. Alba Luz Balderrama is reported to have been thrown off a bridge and has not been seen since. Fears have been increased for the peasants' safety after leaflets were reportedly distributed describing the strike leaders as subversives."
