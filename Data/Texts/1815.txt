 Zimbabwe: Further information on Health concern, Fletcher Dulini-Ncube. | Amnesty International 
 On 8 August, Fletcher Dulini-Ncube was indicted for trial for the  abduction and murder of two supporters of the    ruling  Zimbabwe  African National Union - Patriotic      Front        (ZANU-PF) party. After the High Court        Decision prison     officials placed Fletcher             Dulini-Ncube - who suffers from severe hypertension and   diabetes, and is recovering  in hospital from the         surgical removal of one eye - in leg irons. As he has     complied with all previous bail          conditions, it   therefore appears that any form of         physical       restraint on Fletcher Dulini-Ncube is                     unnecessary.
