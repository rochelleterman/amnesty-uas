 Brazil: Possible extrajudicial executions / fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Jose Miguel dos Santos (18), ""Carlos"", ""Magao"", Husles Souza Santos, male homosexuals and victims of possible extrajudicial executions; ""Aleska"", ""Fabiana"" and other male homosexuals tortured in Maceio, Alagoas: There are fears for the safety of male homosexual prostitutes in Maceio, Alagoas, following reports that this group have been targeted by the civil police. On 6 June a transvestite and two homosexuals were executed with gunshots to the head, reportedly because they had failed to pay their ""fee"" to the police. On 10 June three other transvestites were arrested, beaten and tortured by police, again for allegedly failing to pay the police. There is also concern at alleged death threats being made against Pedro Montegro and Marcelo Nascimento, human rights and homosexual rights activists in Alagoas.
