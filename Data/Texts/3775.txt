"Brazil: Fear for Safety 
 Brazil: Fear for Safety | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the safety of Dr Elma Novais and her children Jefferson and Roxana, following what appears to be a campaign of veiled threats and intimidation against them. This campaign appears designed to intimidate Dr Novais who has been working tirelessly to bring to justice those responsible for killing her son, Josenildo Jo‹o de Freitas Jœnior. He was shot dead in Caruaru, Pernambuco in 1999 by a group of men who witnesses described as military policemen.
