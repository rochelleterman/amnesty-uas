 Brazil: Forced eviction/use of excessive force: 468 families

 | Amnesty International 
 The municipal authorities in S¨o Paulo are preparing to forcibly evict 468 families who have occupied a derelict building in the centre of the city for over two years, to clear the site for commercial development. The police have a history of using excessive force during similar evictions, and Amnesty International believes the families are in grave danger. No alternative accommodation has been arranged for them, and they are likely to be made homeless.
