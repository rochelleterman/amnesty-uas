 Twenty-nine people, including Abdollah Sadoughi, a member of the Iranian Azerbaijani minority, were arrested on 24 August 2011 in Tabriz, north-west Iran. Abdollah Sadoughi’s health has deteriorated following a hunger strike. They may all be prisoners of conscience, held solely for their peaceful activities in defence of their minority’s rights."
