 Colombian activists: systematically attacked and discredited | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 This web action focuses on Colombia where human rights    activists work in extremely difficult conditions - trying to protect human rights in a country suffering an         internal armed conflict; and struggling against a         systematic campaign to discredit their work. The          Colombian state has the obligation to create the basic    conditions for human rights campaigners to work freely.   The President must recognize publicly the legitimacy of   human rights work and end the impunity for human rights   abuses against activists.                                 "
