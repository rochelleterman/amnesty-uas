 Corlson Dorme, radio correspondent with Radio Tropic FM, was released on 7 February 1993. He was reportedly taken to an unidentified location on 1 Janaury 1993 by members of the armed forces, where he was detained blindfolded and badly beaten. He believes that he may have been held at the Delmas 33 detention centre. The men reportedly warned him to stop collaborating with Lavalas (a political movement which supported deposed President Aristide) and to start collaborating with the armed forces. "
