 Yemen: Imminent execution for  Mansour Saif al-Horsome | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Mansour Saif al-Horsome has reportedly been scheduled for execution in two days' time. Amnesty International is concerned that he may not have received a fair trial.
He was convicted of the murder of his wife in 1993.       However, the   president of the court t sentencing him    is     alleged to have been a relative of the prisoner's  wife.   
Mansour Saif al-Horsome was allegedly not given sufficient opportunity to present a defence. His lawyer apparently lost his case file and did not consult him or keep him informed of the progress of the case."
