 Italy: Forcible return/fear for safety/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 The Italian authorities have forcibly returned 180 people to Libya, where they may be at risk of torture. Over 1,000 people recently arrived in Italy are in custody, and the authorities are reportedly planning further deportations. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has not been allowed access to the detainees, and apparently none of those deported was given the effective opportunity to apply for asylum.
