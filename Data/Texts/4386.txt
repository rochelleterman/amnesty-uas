 Colombia: death threats / fear for safety: Civic Human Rights Committee of Meta | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about a death threat telephoned to the Civic Human Rights Committee of Meta in Villavicencio on 15 March 1995. The caller threatened to kill and bomb them. The Committee works with other local non-governmental organizations to assist families who have been displaced from their homes, due to the armed conflict,and to denounce human rights violations by the security forces and by paramilitaries. There has been an upsurge in military and paramilitary activity in recent months in the Ariari region, south of Villavicencio, where there is a strong guerrilla presence."
