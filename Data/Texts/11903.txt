"Japan: Fear of Imminent Executions, Omori Katsuhisa 
 Japan: Fear of Imminent Executions, Omori Katsuhisa | Amnesty International 
 Omori Katsuhisa, currently under sentence of death, may be executed on or around 2 August. As there is a trend of more than one execution taking place at the same time in Japan, there are fears that other executions may also be carried out around this time. Executions are arbitrary and carried out in secret, so there is no official confirmation of the names of those scheduled for execution.
