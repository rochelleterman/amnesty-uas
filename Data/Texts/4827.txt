 UA 226/93 - Colombia: extrajudicial execution / fear for safety: Roison Mora Rubiano, his brother and a friend | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Roison Mora Rubiano was killed on 22 June 1993 in Bogota in circumstances suggesting that he was the victim of extrajudicial execution by a member of the armed forces. There is concern for the safety of his brother and a friend who were with him when he was shot. Witnesses to human rights violations are themselves often subjected to harassment. "
