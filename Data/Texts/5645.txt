 Ecuador: Human rights in jeopardy/Ill-treatment: Estalin Olimpo Coello Rosado | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that a 60-day state of emergency declared on 7 January 1999 in Ecuador's         Province of Guayas, under which certain Constitutional    rights have been suspended, could result in an increase   in human rights violations by the security forces. One    man, Estalin Olimpo Coello Rosado, has already been       beaten by police after being accused of theft.
