 Iran: Further information on: Medical concern/Prisoner of conscience/Incommunicado detention: Akbar Ganji (m) | Amnesty International 
 Prisoner of conscience Akbar Ganji was reportedly sent back from hospital to Evin prison on 3 September, to serve the remainder of his six-year sentence. He had only recently ended a two-month hunger strike, and was in very poor health. He is not known to have met with his lawyer; his family have not been allowed to see him, and they fear that he may be in solitary confinement, where he might not be receiving adequate medical treatment. He is still demanding that the authorities release him unconditionally.
