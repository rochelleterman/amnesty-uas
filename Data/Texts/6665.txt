 Mario Polanco, a member of GAM (Mutual Support Group for the Appearance of our Relatives Alive), was reportedly abducted in Guatemala City on 10 December 1993 by five armed men and held for two hours, during which time he was tied up and severely beaten. His abductors reportedly told him that they were not pleased with his work but would not kill him, only teach him a lesson. After two hours they left him; he managed to get to a hospital where his wounds were treated. Witnesses to the abduction were reportedly threatned with death if they did not keep silent. GAM reported the incident to the police but there are fears that his life is still in danger."
