 Guatemala: Experts who testified at trial threatened | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Four staff members of the Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Foundation (Fundación de Antropología Forense Guatemala - FAFG) have received death threats. The threats occurred days after the end of a high profile trial in which former members of the Army were convicted of a 1982 massacre and sentenced to 6050 years in prison collectively. FAFG provided expert testimony for the trial. Amnesty believes their safety is at risk."
