 Father Marco Arana and Dr Mirtha Vasquez Chuquilin have received repeated death threats and have been followed and filmed both at work and at home. The threats and harassment appear to be directly linked to their work for the Training and Intervention Group for Sustainable Development (Grupo de Formaci¢n e Intervenci¢n para el Desarrollo Sostenible, GRUFIDES), a human rights and environmental organization. Their lives, and those of others associated with GRUFIDES, may be in danger.
