 The three Tamil men above were arrested on 4 July 1993 at Tharapuram, Mannar District by police while they were on their way back to the Pesalai refugee camp from the Mannar Police Station where they had been to sign on. According to reports, the men were later seen under army custody at Suriyakaddaikadu, Mannar District. Relatives have appealed to local representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross, but no information has emerged about their whereabouts. They were previously arrested on 16 November 1990 and detained until August 1992. After their release they were required to report to the Mannar Police Station every two months."
