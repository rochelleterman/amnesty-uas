 Rwanda/Burundi: Further information on fear of refoulement / fear for safety: thousands of Burundi refugees in Rwanda | Amnesty International 
 There is concern that up to 2,000 Burundi refugees in Kigeme camp, Gikongoro prefecture may be at risk of imminent refoulement, despite the fact that they face the risk of grave human rights violations in Burundi. There are also thousands of other Burundi refugees in the prefectures of Cyangugu and Butare who are also at risk of forcible return.
