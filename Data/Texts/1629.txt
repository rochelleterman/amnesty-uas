 Florencio Ela Bibang is reportedly ill with diabetes and requires medical treatment, which he is reportedly being denied. He is being held incommunicado along with Felipe Esono Ntumu and Antimo Edu at the Nigeria Army Intelligence Authority in Lagos. The three men are at risk of being forcibly returned to Equatorial Guinea, where they could be held incommunicado without charge or trial and where they could be tortured.
