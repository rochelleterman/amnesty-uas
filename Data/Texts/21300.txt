 Hungary: Vigilantes threaten Roma community  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Following an anti-Roma march by the far-right Jobbik party in the village of Gyöngyöspata on 6 March 2011, three vigilante groups have been ‘patrolling’ the area harassing and intimidating Roma residents.  Local Roma have allegedly been racially abused and there is fear for their safety. The vigilante groups have announced that their next target will be Roma in the town of Hajdúhadháza. Police have reportedly taken no action."
