 Of the four Shan women and six Shan men arrested at Tachilek on 20 March 1995 , three women and four men are currently still being held at No 24 Intelligence Camp, near Ba Suk Village. There are continued fears for their safety in the light of injuries they reportedly received on arrest. It is reported that Ai Mon had one ear cut off, that Ai Yi had his nose cut; and that Nang Han Ny was slapped on the body. The names of the others still detained are not known. On 3 April another two people were arrested on suspicion of involvement with the Mong Tai Army (MTA). Ai Yi Long and his son Ai Long are believed to be innocent civilians."
