 NA 
 AI is concerned for the safety of Chris Khoza, ANC branch chairperson in Mpophomeni, following killings of other ANC members and supporters in the township by attackers alleged to have acted with the support or acquiescence of the local police. Those already killed include Bheki Maseko, a neighbour of Chris Khoza and a former acting ANC Chairperson. Chris Khoza is a key community leader and active with the local Christian church in Mpophomeni. As a result of threats and this recent wave of killings, he and his family are in hiding outside the township. "
