 Japan: Minister pressured to carry out executions | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Thirteen members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult found guilty of carrying out the gas attack in the Tokyo subway in 1995 are at imminent risk of execution. The Japanese Minister of Justice is under pressure from other ministers to carry out executions before 2012. This means the cult members, and indeed all other death row inmates, are at risk of imminent execution."
