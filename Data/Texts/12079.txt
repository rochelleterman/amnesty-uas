 Chang Ki-pyo and his wife Cho Mu-ha were arrested on national security charges in late September 1992. Both are held by the security service ANSP, which refused to allow lawyers to interview them on 29 September. A Seoul criminal court ruled on 5 October that the ANSP had acted illegally in denying them access to their lawyers. They are among some 60 people who have been arrested since late August in what the authorities have described as the biggest espionage case since the Korean War. "
