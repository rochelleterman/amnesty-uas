 AI fears that Tong Ching-man and Lam Cheuk-wang, both Hong Kong citizens, may soon be executed. They were arrested in December 1988 in the transit lounge of Singapore Airport, en route to Brussels from Hong Kong. They were found to have heroin hidden in their clothing. They were tried in August 1993. Tong Ching-man's appeal has been rejected and she has submitted a petition for clemency. Lam Cheuk-wang is believed also to have submitted a petition for clemency."
