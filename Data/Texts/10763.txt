 NA 
 The Chinese authorities have denied allegations that a group of Christians were severely beaten by police in late March 1993 in Shaanxi province. They also deny that Lai Manping's death was caused by these beatings. Amnesty International is concerned at the perfunctory response to the serious allegations, and urges the government to disclose the details of the investigation reportedly carried out into the Xunyang incident.
