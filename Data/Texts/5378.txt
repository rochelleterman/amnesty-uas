 Colombia: Further information on: Fear for Safety, Civilian inhabitants of rural  communities of the Alto and Bajo Naya regions, Valle del Cauca and Cauca departments | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned at reports that army-backed paramilitary troops have increased their presence in the northern area of Cauca and southern area of Valle del Cauca over the last few days. There are particular concerns for the safety of the 25,000 inhabitants in the Alto and Bajo Naya region in the municipalities of Timba, Su‡rez, Buenos Aires and Buenaventura. Since the massacre of over 32 civilians in this area in April 2001, there have been repeated rumours and threats of a further massacre.
