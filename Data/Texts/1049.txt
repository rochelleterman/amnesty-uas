 Guillaume Soro Kibafori and eight other members of the Ivorian Federation of Student and School Pupils (FECSI) have been held incommunicado wihout charge for more than one month.  AI believes they have been severely ill-treated while in detention and is concerned that they may be at risk of further ill-treatment.  AI also believes they may be prisoners of conscience as they have not been charged with any offence and appear to have been detained solely because of their membership of FECSI."
