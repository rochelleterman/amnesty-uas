 This action reprints extracts from a letter from Ahn So-yung, daughter of Ahn Jae-ku, giving information about her father's treatment in detention. She is concerned that he is still being kept in virtual isolation and that he is suffering from arthritis and rheumatism but is being kept ""alone and neglected"" in a damp room. AI continues to call for his unconditional and immediate release as a prisoner of conscience."
