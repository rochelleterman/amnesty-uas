"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Kosovo province): Fear of ill-treatment / possible extrajudicial executions 
 NA 
 Ethnic Albanians including: Avni Klinaku, Dulah Sallahu, Bejtullah Sallahu, Emin Sallahu, Shukrije Rexha (f), political activist, Majlinda Sinani (f), school teacher and actress, Sinan Azemi, human rights activist; Zahir Pajaziti, Hakif Zejnulahu (both killed): Since 26 January 1997 some 40 ethnic Albanians have been detained, apparently on suspicion that they are members of the so-called ""Liberation Army of Kosovo"". Fears for their safety have increased after the release of Naser Dugolli who has alleged that he was severely ill-treated in police custody. On 31 January three ethnic Albanians, Zahir Pajaziti, Hakif Zejnulahu and one other unnamed person were shot dead by police, who claim they were acting in self-defence. While Amnesty International acknowledges the duty of the authorities to bring to justice any person who has committed violent crimes, it is seeking assurances that those detained are not being subjected to torture or ill-treatment and that the incident on 31 January is fully investigated.
