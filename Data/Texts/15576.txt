 Russian Federation: Fear of forcible return/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 At least 13, possibly 14 ethnic Uzbek men are believed to be in imminent danger of deportation from Russia to Uzbekistan, where they would be at risk of incommunicado detention, torture and unfair trials leading to long prison terms or even the death penalty. Another ethnic Uzbek man, detained with them, reportedly has Russian citizenship but could also be in danger of deportation to Uzbekistan, if the Russian authorities contest his citizenship.
