 The Spanish authorities are preparing to forcibly return Basel Ghalyoun to Syria, where Amnesty International believes he would be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. He was only told of the expulsion order on 17 July 2008, when he was released from prison and immediately taken into custody.  His lawyer has not had been given notification of the expulsion order and so is unable to submit an appeal.  He may be expelled at any time."
