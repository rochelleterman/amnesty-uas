 UA 377/93 - El Salvador: possible political killing / fear for safety: Francisco Velis | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 25 October Francisco Velis was killed by two unidentified men, as he was taking his one-year-old daughter to a creche. In what appears to have been a carefully organized operation, the assailants were able to flee, despite the presence of a National Police patrol in the vicinity. Francisco Velis was a member of the National Council of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), and was standing as the FMLN's candidate for deputy to the National Assembly in the presidential and legislative elections to be held in March 1994.
