 Libya: Death penalty / Unfair trial / Possible prisoners  of conscience.	 | Amnesty International 
 On 16 February, two possible prisoners of conscience, Abdullah Ahmed Izzedin and Salem Abu Hanak, were sentenced to death before a People's Court in Tripoli following an unfair trial. At the same trial, scores of others received sentences ranging from 10 years' to life imprisonment. Amnesty International considers all those detained solely for the peaceful expression of their political beliefs to be prisoners of conscience.
