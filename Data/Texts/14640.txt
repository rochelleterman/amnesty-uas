 UA 207/94 - Turkey: extrajudicial execution and ""disappearance"": Halil Alpsoy, Kasim Alpsoy | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Kasim Alpsoy has not been seen since he was detained at Adana Provincial Gendarmerie Headquarters on 16 May 1994. He had been detained the day before and severely tortured, but had returned with a relative, Sukru, to collect his identity card and valuables. Concern for his safety is heightened as his cousin, Halil Alpsoy, was found dead on 24 May after being detained allegedly by police on 12 May 1994. Both men belong to the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP)."
