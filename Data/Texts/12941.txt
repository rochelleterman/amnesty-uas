 Pakistan: Further information on imminent execution: Mohammad Ali (m) | Amnesty International 
 Mohammad Ali's 15-day stay of execution expired on 24 August, but it will take a further two weeks for a new death warrant to be issued and a new execution date to be set. His family are still negotiating with the family of the man he was convicted of murdering to agree compensation in exchange for pardoning him. If they reach an agreement within two weeks, Mohammad Ali,aged 45, will be set   free.
