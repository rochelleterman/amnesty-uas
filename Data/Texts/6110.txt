 UA 37/94 - Guatemala: death threats / possible extrajudicial execution / fear for safety: Josefa Macaria Calel, Manuela Nas, Francisco Leon Guarcas and other residents of Chiche (fear for safety); Felipe Leon Nas (killed) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Felipe Leon Nas was killed in an apparent extrajudicial execution on 27 December 1993 in the municipality of Chiche, El Quiche department. There is now grave concern for the safety of Josefa Macaria Calel, who has worked closely with Felipe Leon in the past, and who has reportedly been the victim of repeated threats and harassment. She is now in hiding. There is also concern for the other inhabitants of Chiche, particularly Felipe Leon's parents, Manuela Nas and Francisco Leon Guarcas. According to his parents, two weeks after their son was killed, the chief of the Civil Defence Patrols (PAC) in Chiche, allegedly said that the patrollers could take advantage of the prevailing impunity to kill other people in the village."
