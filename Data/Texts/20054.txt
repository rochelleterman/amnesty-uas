 NA 
 Police officers are on trial for the murder of two men,   and the sole witness, Pedro Geovanny Baque, has received  death threats. Police have allegedly tortured the dead    men's brother, Carlos Wilfrido Jartamillo Mera, to make   him implicate this witness in serious crimes. Amnesty     International believes both men and their families are in grave danger."
