 UA 415/94 - South Africa: death threats / fear for safety: Mrs M Mtimkulu, her husband, and her sons, Kulekani and Nkululeko Mtimkulu | Amnesty International

 There are serious concerns for the safety of members of the Mtimkulu family, who have recently been subjected to a series of death threats and attacks. They appear to have been targeted by armed men associated with the local Induna (traditional Headman) who are acting with the acquiescence of the KwaZulu Police."
