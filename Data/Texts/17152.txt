 Iran: Further information on: Death penalty: Ahmed Bakhtari | Amnesty International 
 AI deeply regrets the news that the above, a 41-year-old agricultural engineer, was executed on 22 June 1996 in Evin prison in Tehran. At least one other person is said to have been executed there on the same day. Ahmed Bakhtari had been sentenced to death by an Islamic Revolutionary Court on 17 January 1993, after conviction of charges including activities for an illegal opposition group, sedition and armed robbery. The trial was reportedly unfair as he was said not to have had access to a lawyer.
