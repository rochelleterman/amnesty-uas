 Egypt: Detainees at risk after prison riots | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The fate of detainees Mohamed Abu Essaoud Ismail and Mohamed al-Fateh Basyouni is unknown after riots broke out in the prisons of Natroon II and Fayoum. The two men were being held in administrative detention without charge or trial, and the courts have repeatedly ordered their release. Their families are worried about their fate and fear they might be tortured or otherwise ill-treated by the authorities. Other detainees may be at similar risk."
