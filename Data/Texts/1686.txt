 Nigeria: Fear of ill-treatment / possible prisoner of conscience: Bayo Onanuga | Amnesty International 
 Fears that the above, a senior editor with The News newspaper group, may be ill-treated in custody have been heightened by reports that Babafemi Ojudu, also a senior editor at the group who was released on 13 August 1996, has required hospital treatment as a result of ill-treatment. Bayo Onanuga is believed to be held by the State Security Service at their Lagos headquarters in Shangisha. No official reason has been given for the arrest of the two men but it may have been in connection with articles critical of the government published by the press group.
