 Soldiers went into three rural communities in the southern state of Guerrero between 9 and 13 June 2009, and tortured, shot at, threatened and harassed adults and children. The military incursion was intended to detain members of an armed opposition group, the Insurgent People’s Revolutionary Army (Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo Insurgente, ERPI). The residents of these communities are at imminent risk of further attacks by the military."
