 Ziad Fakraoui is being detained incommunicado and is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. He was arrested on the morning of 25 June 2008 at his family home in the capital, Tunis, by men in civilian clothing. The men identified themselves as state security officials, and told Ziad Fakraoui's mother that they were taking him to the Ministry of the Interior. His family has been unable to obtain any information about him since."
