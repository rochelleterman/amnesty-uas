 USA (Florida): death penalty: Joseph Spaziano | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Joseph Spaziano, white, is scheduled to be executed in Florida on 27 June 1995. He was sentenced to death in 1976 for the murder of a white woman. The jury which tried him recommended life imprisonment but the presiding judge overruled this and passed the death sentence. Joseph Spaziano was reportedly convicted on the testimony of a 16-year-old drug addict who was hypnotized twice to ""refresh"" his memory. The Florida Supreme Court ruled several years after his trial that hypnotically refreshed evidence is unreliable and it is now inadmissible by law."
