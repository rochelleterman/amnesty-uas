 Murad Gasaev was released on 28 August 2009 from a detention centre in the southern Russian town of Piatigorsk. Investigators had found no evidence that he had been involved in the June 2004 attack on government buildings in the Russian republic of Ingushetia. However, according to Murat Gasaevâ€™s lawyer, law enforcement officers have repeatedly threatened his brother that Murad Gasaev would come to harm if he were released."
