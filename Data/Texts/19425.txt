 Burundi: Women under attack | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Sexual violence has been widely used during Burundi's     10-year civil war to terrorize and humiliate the          population. This action urges the public to write to the  President of Burundi, appealing for a strong public       stance on violence against women, to send a clear message that it is neither inevitable nor acceptable and that     those responsible will be brought to justice."
