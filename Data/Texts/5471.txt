 AI is concerned that at least two journalists may face imprisonment as prisoners of conscience as part of an apparent crackdown on the activities of independent journalists in Cuba. Rafael Solano and Hector Peraza and four other journalists working for the ""Havana Free Press"" agency were detained on 12 July 1995. Five of the men appear to have been released after a few hours; it is not clear if Hector Peraza is still being held. AI is calling for independent journalists in Cuba to be allowed to carry out their legitimate journalistic activities without interference from the authorities."
