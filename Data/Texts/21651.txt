 The authorities in Moldova have threatened to arrest a group of civil society activists who organized a peaceful demonstration, blaming them for the rioting that followed the next day. Amnesty International is concerned that the Moldovan authorities are attempting to blame them for violent rioting that took place in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, on 7 April 2009. "
