 Since 2 April 2008 dozens of people protesting against being turned down for recruitment into the army have been arrested or injured by police dispersing their recent demonstrations in various cities in the south of Yemen. The place of detention of those arrested is unknown, but they are believed to be held incommunicado and may be at risk of torture or other ill-treatment."
