"India / Bhutan: Further information on imminent extradition / fear of torture: Rongthong Kunley Dorji 
 NA 
 There remains concern that Rongthong Kunley Dorji, a 58-year-old Bhutanese national, may be at risk of extradition to Bhutan where he could be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. He is the chairman of the United Front for Democracy (UFD) in Bhutan, a political organization in exile, and was arrested by police at its offices in New Delhi on 18 April. On 26 May the High Court dismissed the habeas corpus petition filed on his behalf. He is currently held on an extended restriction order valid until 5 June. In another development, it has been reported that the High Court of Bhutan issued a new warrant for his arrest on 25 April 1997 which no longer includes charges under the National Security Act relating to ""anti-national"" activities. There is concern that this was done to circumvent the provisions in the Indian Extradition Act which exclude extradition of people on political grounds.
