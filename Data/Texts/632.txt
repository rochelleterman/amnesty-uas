 Mohamed Houmed Soulleh began a hunger strike on 11 October in protest against his continued detention and treatment in prison. A provisional order for his release is being challenged, but he now has access to his family and lawyer. He is held in Gabode prison in the capital, Djibouti, where he complains that he is held in a crowded cell and has been threatened by prison guards. "
