 A further 490 Eritrean asylum-seekers have been deported to Massawa in Eritrea, and hundreds more are apparently detained at Central Security Forces camp in Shallal, south of Aswan. The camp has served as a gathering point for asylum-seekers before they are taken to Aswan airport. On 12 June 2008, a security official confirmed that 200 Eritreans had been ""sent back home"" the previous day."
