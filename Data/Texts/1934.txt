 AI has recently received a response from Rwanda's Vice Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, to the letters sent to him concerning two army officers sentenced to death on 11 May 1995.  He asks AI to inform those who have written that the judicial procedure in the case of the two men has not been exhausted and that the sentences are yet to be confirmed."
