 Iran: Further information on Imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Six men were executed on 17 January. They were hanged at dawn, according to press reports citing Iranian state radio. A further three were apparently pardoned by the victims' families, while the executions of the remaining two men had been postponed. New reports indicate that Maryam Ayoubi will not receive a fifteen year prison sentence but will simply be stoned to death.
