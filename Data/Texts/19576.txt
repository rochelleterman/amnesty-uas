 The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has called for a general strike to begin on 15 April 2008, to protest at the delay in releasing the results of the presidential election which took place on 29 March.   With the delay to the release of the results there has been an escalation of violence in which soldiers, police, war veterans and political party supporters have been implicated.  "
