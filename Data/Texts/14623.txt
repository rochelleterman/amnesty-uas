 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of the above people, who were detained by police in the Bakirkoy-Gungoren district of Istanbul on 27 April 1993. All ten detainees are now being interrogated in incommunicado detention at the Anti-Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters and it is feared that they may be subjected to torture. Ahmet Kosemehmetoglu, an asthma sufferer, has previously been detained and remanded in custody for membership of the Turkish Revolutionary Communist Party. "
