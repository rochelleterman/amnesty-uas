 A Pakistani national has been sentenced to death in the United Arab Emirates and is at imminent risk of execution. According to press reports, he was sentenced to death on charges of drug trafficking, and has had his sentence confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Sharjah in January. Eleven others, also Pakistani nationals, received sentences of between 10 and 15 years' imprisonment. This is reportedly the first case in which the death penalty has been imposed for drug-trafficking in the UAE."
