 Iran: Further information on arbitrary arrest/ fear of torture or other ill-treatment/ prisoner of conscience: Mahboubeh Karami | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Mahboubeh Karami was charged within the past week with ""acting against national security,"" and the Revolutionary Court in Mahabad has scheduled her next hearing for 1 November 2008, according to her lawyer. She has been held in Evin Prison in Tehran since 13 June 2008. Amnesty International believes the charge is false, and that Mahboubeh Karami is a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of expression and association."
