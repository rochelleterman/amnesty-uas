 Orton Chirwa, the prisoner of conscience who died in Zomba Central Prison on 20 October 1992, was buried in his home area on 1 November. Some 10,000 people reportedly attended the funeral, which passed peacefully. His widow Vera, also a prisoner of conscience in Zomba Central Prison, was not allowed to attend. AI is concerned that her children, who returned from exile for the funeral, have apparently not been allowed to visit her. This contradicts an assurance given by the Commissioner of Prisons to a British delegation of lawyers in September 1992. AI is also concerned about the detention of a Presbyterian minister, Reverend Aaron Longwe and a schoolboy and school receptionist in connection with an art poster about Orton Chirwa. Rev. Longwe has since been released. "
