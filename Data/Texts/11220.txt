 Gurdeep Singh has not been seen since his arrest on 13 August 1995. He was reportedly arrested by a Station House Officer and an Assistant Sub-Inspector from Hamidi police post, Barnala police station, Sangrur district in the Punjab. The police have denied in court that Gurdeep Singh was arrested, but have reportedly harassed his family and demanded payment in return for his release. He had reportedly been picked up by police a few months ago and was only released when the family paid a Rs20,000 bribe to police. A further court hearing to determine his whereabouts is set for 23 August."
