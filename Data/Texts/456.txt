 NA 
 Ghandi Che Ngwa, an auditor for a government development agency detained under state of emergency regulations, died on or about 18 November 1992, allegedly as a result of injuries inflicted during torture. He had been arrested at his office in Bamenda on 9 November and taken to the headquarters of the Brigade mixte mobile, where he was allegedly severely tortured. On 13 November he was taken to the Military Hospital. He died there a week later. He was apparently accused of involvement in the violence following the results of the presidential elections in Cameroon, although unofficial sources deny this. Detainees have reported beatings and torture with electricity at the BMM headquarters. "
