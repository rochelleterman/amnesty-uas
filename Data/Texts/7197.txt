 Mexico: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Up to 250 students were reportedly beaten and arrested by police at a university campus in Mexico City on 1         February 2000. Amnesty International is concerned that    excessive force was apparently used in the arrests, and   that they may face further ill-treatment in detention.
