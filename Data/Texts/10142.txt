 According to reports, on 2 February 1994, members of the Task Force 1.2 of the Venezuelan army, reportedly opened fire on a crowd of Yucpa Indians in the village of Kasmera, Perija Hills, state of Zulia. In the attack Felipe Romero, Vicente Romero and Carmen Romero were killed, and Francisco Romero and Nirida Romero, aged 12, were reportedly injured. They had apparently been protesting after the army confiscated a batch of wood gathered by the community. In July 1993, 33 peasants had been arrested and allegedly ill-treated by the army. Idelfonso Carmona, a land rights activist, was harassed and threatened after denouncing the army's actions. He was killed on 26 November 1993 by a masked man."
