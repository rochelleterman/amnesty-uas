"Bosnia-Herzegovina: Fear for safety 
 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned about the lack of safety and security for Bosnian Serbs who are returning to the Drvar municipality in western Bosnia-Herzegovina where levels of harassment are on the increase. An elderly couple, Vojin and Lela Trninic, were murdered on their return to their pre-war home village. Many of these incidents have not been properly investigated by the  authorities and the UN has called for the suspension of a number of Bosnian Croat offcials responsible for the area.
