 UA 50/93 - Haiti: harassment / fear for safety: Monsignor Willy Romelus | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about the reported ill-treatment of the Bishop of Jeremie Monsignor Willy Romelus, an outspoken critic of the regime in Haiti, on 25 February 1993 after officiating at a funeral mass for the victims of the recent ferry-boat disaster. The mass had turned into an anti-government demonstration. Mgr. Romelus was reportedly attacked by a group of armed civilians after the mass while members of the security forces stood by. He was rescued by members of a UN delegation. Mgr. Romelus has been subjected to intimidation for some time. "
