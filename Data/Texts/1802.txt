 Zimbabwe: Further information on Arbitrary arrests/Fear for Safety/Conditions of Detention/Prisoners of conscience, An estimated 1400 people. | Amnesty International 
 Around 1,400 people have been arrested during Zimbabwe's presidential election, most of those arrested were held for up to 48 hours but then released without charge. However, around 100 polling agents for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and others perceived to be MDC supporters are either in police custody or held by state-sponsored militias. Amnesty International believes they are held arbitrarily, and are at risk of torture.
