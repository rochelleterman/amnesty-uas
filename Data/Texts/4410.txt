 Colombia: Possible ""Disappearance"" / Reported excessive use of force by the police and army | Amnesty International 
 On 11 February 2000, three children from the U'wa         indigenous population were killed and three others        injured after the police and    army reportedly violently evicted them from land they had occupied as part of a     protest against an oil company. Amnesty International is  now very concerned for the       safety of Eleonor        HERRERA (baby), Luz Helena HERRERA, Wilson HERRERA,       Gustavo DELGADO, Antonio DELGADO, Nelson DIAZ, Edgard     DIAZ, Alfredo DIAZ and Wilson DIAZ who are missing.
