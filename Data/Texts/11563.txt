 The four men named above, officials of non-governmental organizations campaigning for workers' rights, have recently been accused of ""incitement"" in connection with a wave of labour unrest in Medan, North Sumatra, in April 1994. It is thought they will be charged under Article 160 of the Indonesian Criminal Code. If convicted they would be prisoners of conscience. Jannes Hutahaen and Parlin Manihuruk were abducted in Jakarta on 13 June by police from Medan, but it is not known where they are being held. Maiyasyak Johan and Muchtar Pakpahan have also been questioned by police."
