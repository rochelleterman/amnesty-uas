 Colombia: Human rights defenders threatened | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 8 May 2012, three human rights defenders and a lawyer in Sucre, northern Colombia, received death threats. All four have been supporting peasant farmers to get back land seized during the armed conflict. Other human rights defenders, also working on land restitution and campaigning against impunity, were threatened at the end of April."
