 Ecuador: Community leaders sentenced for protesting | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 14 August 2012, the National Court of Ecuador sentenced community leaders Carlos Pérez, Federico Guzmán, and Efraín Arpi to eight days in prison for blocking a road during a protest against proposed legislation that the men claim would affect their community’s access to water and was not adequately consulted on. A warrant for their arrest is due to be issued.  This ruling shows how the criminal justice system is being used to deter public protests. "
