 USA (Florida): death penalty: Bernard Bolender | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Bernard Bolender, white, is scheduled to be executed in Florida on 12 July 1995. He was sentenced to death in 1980 for his role in drug related murders. The jury at his trial unanimously recommended a life sentence - according to his attorneys, because of doubts about his guilt. However, this was overridden by the trial judge, whom Bolender's attorneys describe as a ""notorious hanging judge"" who has imposed a number of death sentences where a jury has recommended life sentence."
