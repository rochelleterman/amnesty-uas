 UA 392/94 - Albania: three homosexual activists | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about the arrest and beating of three members of Shoqata Gay Albania (SGA, Gay Albania Society) by police on 14 and 15 October 1994. The three were reportedly severely beaten in Tirana district 1 police station. They have since been released but one of had to be admitted to hospital, unconscious and with a broken leg. It appears that they may be charged with engaging in homosexual acts, an offence under the present criminal code. The police reportedly accused the men of belonging to an illegal organization and demanded the names of others in the SGA."
