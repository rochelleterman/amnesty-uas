 People's Republic of China/Democratic People's Republic   of Korea: Further information on forcible Return / Fear for Safety -             Asylum-seekers from North Korea

 | Amnesty International 
 More evidence has come to light that the Chinese          Government has been contravening the principle of         non-refoulement by forcibly returning scores of North     Korean asylum-seekers to their country. Amnesty           International is concerned that those forcibly returned   are at risk of severe human rights violations, including  prison terms, or even the death penalty. According to     some reports, many are subject to torture and             ill-treatment while in prison camps.
