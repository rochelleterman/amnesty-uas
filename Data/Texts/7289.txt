 Mexico: Fear of intimidation/ fear of ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Members of a community living on communal land are staging a protest after renting part of the land to a mining company, which they believe has not honoured its agreement with the community. It is feared that they may be forced to leave the site of their protest by state and municipal police. Amnesty International believes they     risk being intimidated, beaten or wrongly arrested in an attempt to halt their protests.
