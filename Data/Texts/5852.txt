 El Salvador: Death penalty: Possible reintroduction of the death penalty | Amnesty International 
 The Legislative Assembly in El Salvador is about to debate a motion which would reintroduce the death penalty for certain crimes. Should this proposal be approved, El Salvador would be violating Article 4 (3) of the American Convention on Human Rights which states that the death penalty shall not be re-established in states that have abolished it.
