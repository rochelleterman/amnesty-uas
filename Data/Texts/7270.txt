 There is growing concern for the safety of members of the Catholic Church in Chiapas, who are reported to be facing threats and harassment. On 4 February 1995, Hose Alberto Paniagua Mijangos, a seminarist, was reportedly followed by people in an unmarked car, who threated him with ""misfortunes"" if he continued with his pastoral work. On 12 February, the Policia Judicial Federal (PJF) interrupted mass and interrogated Father Javier Ruiz Velazco about his alleged link with armed oppositions. On 15 February, PJF members are reportedly to have searched the Church of Santo Jacinto and on the same day to have raided the Convent of the Dominican Brothers and Sisters, this time without a warrant."
