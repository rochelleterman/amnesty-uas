 Turkey: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/fear of 'disappearance': Ibrahim Alpdogan | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the      safety of Ibrahim Alpdo an who was taken into custody     from his village on 20 June 1999 by soldiers from Pazarc  k Gendarmerie Command, and is now reportedly detained     either at Pazarc k Gendarmerie Command or at police       headquarters in Kahraman Mara  town, South Eastern        Turkey. The fact that the authorities have not            acknowledged that he is in detention increases the risk   that he may be tortured or ill-treated.
