 Zimbabwe: Fear for safety of farming communities and      opposition political activists in rural areas | Amnesty International 
 Opposition activists and supporters, real or perceived,   are being intimidated and attacked, and at least six have been killed, in rural areas by so-called ""war veterans""   and other supporters of the ruling party, Zimbabwe        African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). Far   from condemning these abuses, which are continuing with   the apparent complicity or acquiescence of the            authorities, President Mugabe has repeatedly made         statements supporting those responsible.
