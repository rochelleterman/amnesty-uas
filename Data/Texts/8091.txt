 AI fears that the above are in danger of being re-detained as actual or possible prisoners of conscience. If re-detained, all would be at the risk of torture in police custody. Cesar Augusto Sosa Silupu was a prisoner of conscience between August 1992 to July 1993. On 6 June 1995 the Supreme Court of Justice ruled to annul the decision to absolve him on procedural grounds and ordered a new trial. A re-detention order is expected to be issued in the next few days. If he is re-detained AI would consider him once again to be a prisoner of conscience. This problem could be faced by 300 other prisoners."
