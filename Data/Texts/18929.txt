 Algeria: Further information on secret detention/fear of torture: Abdelmajid Touati (m) | Amnesty International 
 Abdelmajid Touati was brought before a judge on 11 September and charged with ""belonging to a terrorist group operating in Algeria and abroad"", among other offences. He had been held at an undisclosed location, without any contact with the outside world, for nearly five months. He has now been sent to prison and is believed no longer to be at risk of torture. Three other men (Mohamed Amine Rabah Ajine, Zeineddine Belacel and Mohamed El Habib Boukhatemi) are being held incommunicado in relation to the same case, and are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.
