 NA 
 A major new crime bill, which extends the federal death penalty to cover around 60 crimes, including non-homicidal offences, has finally passed the US Senate. President Clinton is expected to sign it into law at the end of August. AI is concerned about the passing of a bill extending the federal death penalty and regrets that the Racial Justice Act was not included in the final bill."
