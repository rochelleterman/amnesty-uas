 Russian Federation: Fear for safety, Imran EZHIEV (m) | Amnesty International 
 Imran Ezhiev, a prominent Chechen human rights defender, was recently detained overnight and reportedly ill-treated by police in Ingushetia. He was released when the head of the Presidential Human Rights Commission intervened. He has been persecuted by the authorities for some time, and Amnesty International is concerned that he will now face further retaliation.
