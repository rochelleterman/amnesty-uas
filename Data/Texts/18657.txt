 Eight Iranian Arab activists (Faleh 'Abdullah al-Mansuri, Rasool Mezrea', Taher 'Ali Mezra', Jamal 'Abdawi, Musa Suwari, Ahmad 'Abd al-Jaber Abiat, Jamal Obeidi and 'Issa Yassin al-Musawi) were arrested in the capital, Damascus, on 11 May. They are held incommunicado at an unknown location, where they are at risk of torture and of being forcibly returned to Iran, where they would face persecution and possibly the death penalty. A number of other Arab activists were reportedly arrested with them, including one man who has already been returned to Iran.
