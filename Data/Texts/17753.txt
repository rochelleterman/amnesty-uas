 Israel / South Lebanon: Incommunicado detention / fear of torture or ill-treatment: 'Ali Diya | Amnesty International 
 The above, a Lebanese national arrested in South Lebanon on 13 June 1996 and since transferred to Israel, remains in incommunicado detention and may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. 'Ali Diya, a dentist who works as a journalist for AFP and other media, was apparently asked to report to the South Lebanese Army, a Lebanese militia which, in cooperation with the Israeli Defence Forces, controls the so-called ""Security Zone"". He has not been seen since responding to the order on 13 June. The AFP lawyer has made several attempts to visit him but has been denied access on each occasion. The Israeli Defence Forces have reportedly stated that he was suspected of collaborating with Hizbullah.
