 Twenty-five student members of FESCI, including those named above, were released on 31 May 1994 after making what appeared to be a forced public apology on television. They were held incommunicado for two weeks, far in excess of the legal maximum of 96 hours. At least five other students arrested with Eugene Gonthy remain in detention without trial."
