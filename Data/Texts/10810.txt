 Wang Wanxing was arrested by plainclothes police on 3 June 1992 while trying to unfurl a banner in Tiananmen Square to commemorate the events of 4 June 1989. In an interview secretly filmed in April 1993 by British-based Yorkshire Television, Wang Wanxing confirms that since July 1992 he has been confined in the An Kang psychiatric hospital in Beijing run by the Public Security Bureau (police), and is being forced to take sedative drugs. He was previously held for a month in Chao Yang detention centre. There is no further information about the other man who was reportedly detained with Wang Wanxing. "
