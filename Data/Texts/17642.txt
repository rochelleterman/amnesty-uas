 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the well-being of three Palestinian women: 'Abla Sa'adat, human rights defender, Iman Abu Farah, and Fatma Zayed who are being detained without charge by the Israeli army. They are being held in harsh conditions which amount to ill-treatment. All three women are reportedly in poor health after going on hunger strike in protest at their detention conditions.
