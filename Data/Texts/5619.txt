 NA 
 Narciso Gonzalez, a lecturer at the Autonomous University of Santa Domingo and a journalist and political activist, has reportedly ""disappeared"" after being arrested on 26 May 1994 by members of the Army. A few days before the presidential elections on 16 May, Narciso Gonzalez had published an article critical of President Balaguer. Reports suggest that he was confined in the J-2 military base after his arrest but the authorities have neither acknowledged his detention nor confirmed where he is being held. There is concern for his safety."
