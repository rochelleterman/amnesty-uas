 Bangladesh: Fear for safety: Ahmadiyya community headquarters

 | Amnesty International 
 Islamist leaders have threatened to attack the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat religious community's headquarters in the capital, Dhaka. They say they will ""lay siege to"" the community's headquarters in Dhaka on 27 August unless the government declares the sect to be ""non-Muslim"". This is the latest of a series of similar attempts by Islamist groups to prevent the Ahmadis from openly practising their beliefs, and have led to incidents of the Islamist groups trying to shut down community centres, putting up hate signs on their places of worship and confiscating their religious materials and prayer books. Amnesty International believes they are at risk of violent attack.
