 United Arab Emirates: Further information on fear of torture / fear of refoulement and new medical concern: Sheikh 'Abd al-Mun'im al-'Ali, 'Abd al-Jalil 'Ilwan | Amnesty International

 'Abd al-Jalil 'Ilwan was released around 20 August and deported to an Arab country, though not Iraq, as previously feared. Sheikh 'Abd al-Mun'im al-'Ali, a possible prisoner of conscience, remains in incommunicado detention. He was apparently hospitalized earlier this month. The reason for his hospitalization is not known. AI is calling for him to be allowed immediate access to his lawyer and relatives. AI is also seeking clarification of the reasons for his arrest and is calling for him not to be returned to Iraq, where he would be at risk of human rights violations."
