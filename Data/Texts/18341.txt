 Saudi Arabia: Further information on: Fear of death sentence/Unfair Trial | Amnesty International 
 Suliamon Olyfemi is believed to have been sentenced to death. At a sentencing hearing on 16 May 12 other men who had been tried with him, say they were told that he was to suffer the death penalty. It is usual in Saudi Arabia for condemned prisoners not to be told of their sentence until they are taken from their cells to be executed.
