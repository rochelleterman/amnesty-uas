 NA 
 Kermit Smith, white, is scheduled to be executed in North Carolina on 24 January 1994. He was sentenced to death for the murder of a black woman in 1980. According to the North Carolina Resource Center, his trial was fundamentally unfair because the authorities were anxious to secure a conviction to demonstrate that they were not racially biased. Kermit Smith reportedly also has a long history of mental disturbance."
