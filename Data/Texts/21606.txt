 Armenia: Arbitrary arrest/Fear of torture or other ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Opposition politicians Aleksandr Arzoumanian and Ararat Zurabian were arrested on 10 March 2008 in the capital, Yerevan. Dozens of opposition activists have also been arrested before and since the disputed presidential election of 19 February. All are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment; there have been numerous reports of the beating of detainees while in police custody, while others believe they have been imprisoned solely on account of their political beliefs."
