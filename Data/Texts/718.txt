 Equatorial Guinea: Further information on fear of forced evictions/ fear of use of excessive force | Amnesty International 
 Over one hundred families of the over 360 at risk have been evicted from their homes in several neighbourhoods in Malabo, the capital. To date, none of the families have been given adequate notice of the eviction, and the authorities have not consulted the affected communities. The communities have not been offered adequate alternative accommodation or compensation, and they have not been given the opportunity to contest the evictions in court.
