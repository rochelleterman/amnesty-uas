 AI has learned that Santos Soto Ramirez and Macario de la Cruz Martinez, the two Indian peasant activists feared to be at risk of ""disappearance"" after being detained on 11 August 1995, are now in prison. Their detention was acknowledged between 14 and 15 August 1995 but reports indicate that they have not been able to receive vists from lawyers, doctors or relatives. They are reportedly accused of 12 murders. AI fears that they have been tortured or ill-treated while in unacknowledged detention and is seeking assurances that they are being humanely treated and have access to lawyers, doctors and their families."
