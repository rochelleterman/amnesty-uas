 NA 
 Khamsone Vongnarath, a 31-year-old Lao student in Ukraine, was forcibly flown back to Laos on 21 December 1992 by officials of the Lao Embassy in Moscow. He is apparently suspected of opposing Lao Government policies. According to other Lao students, Khamsone Vongnarath, who was studying international relations in Kiev, was in Moscow to visit friends. He appears to have been detained on 12 December by Lao officials within the compound of the Lao embassy. AI is concerned that he could be detained as a prisoner of conscience and ill-treated or tortured in Laos. "
