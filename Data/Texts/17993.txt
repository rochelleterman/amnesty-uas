 On 8 December 2003 Ra'ed Muhammad Hijazi was sentenced to death for the third time by the State Security Court (SSC), apparently on charges including plotting to carry out ""terrorist"" activity; illegal possession of explosive material and an unlicensed automatic weapon. Ra'ed Muhammad Hijazi's lawyers will reportedly appeal to the Court of Cassation (appeal court) against this decision.
