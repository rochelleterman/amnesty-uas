 UA 123/94 - Argentina: death in custody / death threats: Diego Rodriguez Laguens | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern at allegations that in late February 1994 police officers in San Pedro, Jujuy province beat Diego Rodriguez Laguens to death, and that they may now be attempting to cover up the killing by presenting it as the result of a road accident. Witnesses are said to have been intimidated and his mother, Mabel Cristina Laguens de Rodriguez, the family lawyer, Dr Federico Uber, and an independent forensic expert have all reportedly received death threats."
