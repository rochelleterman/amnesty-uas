 Between 30 October and 1 November, eight Darfuris, including a number of human rights activists, have been arrested in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. Although the authorities have not yet acknowledged the arrests, there are reports from Sudan that all eight of them are being held incommunicado by the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), without access to a lawyer or their families. They are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. "
