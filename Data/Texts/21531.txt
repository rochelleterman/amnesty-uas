 NA 
 There is concern for the physical and mental health of    Professor Yury Bandazhevsky, a medical academic           specialising in nuclear medicine. He was sentenced to     eight years' imprisonment on 18 June 2001. He was charged and convicted of receiving bribes from students. Amnesty  International believes that his conviction is related to  scientific research into the Chernobyl nuclear reactor    catastrophe of 1986 and his open criticism of the state   authorities. He is considered a prisoner of conscience."
