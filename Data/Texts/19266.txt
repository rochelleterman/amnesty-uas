 Tunisia: Further information on fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Surveillance and harassment of human rights defenders in  Tunisia has been stepped up once again. Human rights      defenders are being continually harassed and intimidated, including being arrested and imprisoned. Increasingly     members of Amnesty International's Tunisian Section are   being targeted despite the fact that they do not work on  human rights issues concerning Tunisia.
