 The ten Christian prisoners of conscience listed above have been arbitrarily detained since 10 February 1994, and there is concern that three Chinese Christians among them are at risk of being held without charge or trial. They were reportedly detained by the Henan province Public Security Bureau. The seven foreigners are being held under house arrest in Fangcheng City No 1 Guesthouse in Henan province. On 31 January 1994 two new regulations governing religious activity became law, and it is thought that the seven foreigners may have been detained under this new legislation."
