 NA 
 AI is gravely concerned at the reported rape of Sonebia Pinzon Herrera and her two-year-old daughter Marcela by soldiers who arrived at their house at approximately 1.30 am on 7 November 1992, claiming to be looking for weapons. Luis Fernando Martinez was taken away from the house by soldiers but managed to alert his mother, who lived nearby, and was allowed to go with her into her home. Sonebia Pinzon has stated that she was taken onto the patio with her three-year-old son and was raped by soldiers who appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. She heard her daughter screaming and later found her semi-conscious; she had been raped. Marcela was medically examined and the rapes were denounced to local and regional authorities. "
