 UA 44/94 - India: ""disappearance"" / legal concern / intimidation: Harjit Singh | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern at the lack of progress in legal proceedings initiated in October 1992 to establish the whereabouts of Harjit Singh, who ""disappeared"" after his arrest in April 1992. This lack of progress appears to be due largely to delaying tactics by the police, and the recent absences of the judge hearing the case, most recently on 9 February 1994. Furthermore, there is concern at reports of attempts to intimidate Harjit Singh's father who has been trying to discover his son's whereabouts."
