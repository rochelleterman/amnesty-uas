 AI is appealing for the immediate and unconditional release of the above-named members of the Convergence for Social Democracy (CPDS), one of the main opposition parties in Equatorial Guinea. At the time of their arrest they were on their way to Niefang, in Rio Muni region, to investigate reported human rights violations. They are now held incommunicado at Niefang police station. AI fears that they were arrested because of their political and human rights activities."
