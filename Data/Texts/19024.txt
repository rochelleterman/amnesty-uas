 NA 
 There is grave concern at the ""disappearance"" in police custody of Moncef Zidi after his arrest on 30 December 1996. He was previously arrested in 1993 and sentenced in absentia to six months' imprisonment, on charges of belonging to the unauthorized Tunisian Workers' Communist Party (PCOT). He had been out on bail awaiting a retrial at the time of his arrest.
