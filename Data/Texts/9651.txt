 Mario Marquez, of Mexican origin, is scheduled to be executed in Texas on 17 January 1995. He was sentenced to death for the murder of his wife and niece. His attorneys report that he is mentally retarded and brain damaged and that evidence of this was not presented to the jury which sentenced him. The jury also did not hear evidence relating to his reportedly abusive and traumatic childhood. Appeal courts have refused to consider this information, saying that it is procedurally barred as it should have been presented at trial."
