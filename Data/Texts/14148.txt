 NA 
 Serday Ay was detained in Diyarbakir on 18 December 1992. His detention has so far not been acknowledged by the authorities. His father has been trying to locate him and was initally told that he was being held by the gendarmerie in the Ofis district of Diyarbakir. However the gendarmerie there denied holding him. He submitted a written request to the Diyarbakir Chief Prosecutor's office but was told that no person by the name of Serdar Ay was in police custody. There have been reported complaints against Serdar Ay for playing Kurdish music in his minibus. He was detained briefly about two months ago by the gendarmerie in Pirinclik. There is grave concern for his safety. "
