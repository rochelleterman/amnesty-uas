 On 25 May 1995 Malatya State Security Court released Ali Ekber Kaya, who is charged with membership in the illegal MLKP-K (Marxist-Leninist Communist Party). However, the four others also detained around 21 March in Tunceli, and later charged with the same offence, Huseyin Dagdeviren, Gulbahar Gunduz, Funda Sarigul and Veysel Yagan, remain in custody. There is particular concern about the health of Gulbahar Gunduz who suffers from asthma and is reportedly suffering from partial paralysis of the legs, allegedly as a result of torture. At the first hearing of her trial on 25 May she was half unconscious and could not walk unaided. During the hearing she reported that police had frequently tortured her and threatened to rape and kill her while in police custody in Tunceli. The prosecutor at Malatya Closed Prison has refused requests that she be treated in hospital. The other detainees have also made formal complaints that they were tortured by police."
