 Those listed above were reportedly punched and kicked by police on 27 September 1994 in what is emerging as a pattern of police villence against people being evicted from flats formerly owned by the Yugoslav National Army. They include two human rights activists, Zoran Pusic and Vesna Bernadic. AI fears that others will be similarly ill-treated in future evictions. A speaker for the Croatian Ministry of Defence has reportedly announced a further 3000 evictions. Several of those beaten on 27 September 1994 reportedly sustained injuries."
