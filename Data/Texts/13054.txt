 UA 57/93 - Philippines: unacknowledged detention / fear of ""disappearance"": Andrea Basabe Espra, Teofanes Areja, Cresencio Caburnay | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Andrea Basabe Espra, a 52-year-old widow and church worker, is feared ""disappeared"" after being arrested on 25 February 1993 by members of the police in Catmon, Cebu. Two others, Teofanes Areja and Cresencio Caburnay, arrested on 13 and 26 February respectively, are also feared to have ""disappeared"". Police have failed to inform relatives of their whereabouts despite repeated requests, or to permit access to them. A radio broadcast on 27 February reportedly announced that Andrea Basabe Espra was being held for ""tactical interrogation"" by members of the 342nd company of the Mobile Field Force of the Philippines National Police at their headquarters in Camp Don Pedro Rodriquez, Bogo, Cebu, but this was subsequently denied.
