 USA (North Carolina): Death penalty / Legal concern: James Edward Thomas (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 James Thomas, black, aged 51, is due to be executed in North Carolina at 2am on 2 February 2007 for the murder of Teresa Ann West, a white woman, in June 1986. He was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in 1987. The state Supreme Court overturned the death sentence in 1991 because the jury had been wrongly instructed. A new sentencing was held in 1995, at which James Thomas was again condemned to death.
