 Yemen: Fear of torture/Medical concern/possible prisoner of conscience: Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Journalist Abdul Karim al-Khaiwani was arrested on 20 June, and is at risk of torture and ill-treatment. He appears to be a prisoner of conscience, held solely for his peaceful criticism of the government. He suffers from a heart condition, but the authorities have refused to allow him any medical attention.
