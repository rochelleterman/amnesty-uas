 Syria: Prisoner of conscience/medical concern: 'Aref Dalilah (m) | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is gravely concerned about the deteriorating health of prisoner of conscience, 'Aref Dalilah. According to reports, he recently suffered a stroke and is now completely numb down the left side of his body, and his left hand and foot are swollen. 'Aref Dalilah is demanding access to medical care independent of the prison authorities, which the authorities have apparently repeatedly refused to provide in the past.
