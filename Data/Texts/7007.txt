 Honduras: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Donny Reyes, treasurer of LGBT rights group ""Asociaci¢n   Arcoiris"" (Rainbow Association), was reportedly           arbitrarily detained by police in Tegucigalpa, on 18      March. The officers beat him and then took him to a       police station where they left him in a cell for six and  a half hours, where other detainees repeatedly raped and  beat him, allegedly encouraged by a police officer. Donny Reyes has lodged a formal complaint about this. Since     then police appear to have attempted to intimidate him.   Amnesty International believes that he, and other members of the organisation he heads, may be in grave danger.
