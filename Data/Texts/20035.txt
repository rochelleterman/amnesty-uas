 NA 
 The Dominican Republic signed the Rome Statute of the     International Criminal Court (Rome Statute) on 8          September 2000. Senior Dominican Republic                 parliamentarians have expressed their support for the     International Criminal Court (ICC), and the Organization  of American States recently called on all member states   that have not yet ratified the Rome Statute to consider   doing so (AG Res. 2039, 8 June 2004). Amnesty             International and the Coalition for the International     Criminal Court (CICC) are calling on the Dominican        Republic to complete its ratification process as soon as  possible."
