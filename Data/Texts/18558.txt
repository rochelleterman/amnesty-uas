 Syria: Medical concern / prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has received information that Jurays al-Talli, Nu'man 'Abdu, Salama George Kayla and Mahmud 'Isa were transferred at the end of July to Tadmur Military Prison apparently as a form of punishment. There are fears that they may be tortured and ill-treated, and suffer inhuman and degrading treatment.
