 Indonesia: possible prisoners of conscience: Tri Agus Susanto, Syahrul | Amnesty International

 The two men named above, activists from the Pijar Foundation, a non-governmental organization based in Jakarta, were detained on 9 and 10 March 1995. AI is concerned that they were detained because of their activities in relation to the publication of an independent magazine critical of the Indonesian government. Their arrests continue the pattern of harassment of government critics. They have been charged under Article 154 of the Criminal Code, one of the so-called ""Hate-sowing Articles"". Unless charged with a recognizably criminal offence, AI is calling for them to be released immediately and unconditionally."
