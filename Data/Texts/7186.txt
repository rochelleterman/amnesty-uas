 Laura Berenice Medina Bocanegra (f), aged 31, community activist, Luis Fernando Flores Medina, aged 11, her son: On 17 January 1997 Laura Berenice Medina Bocanegra, a community activist from Tepoztlan, was followed to work by two men, who she recognized as being the same two members of the security forces who had followed and attacked her on 12 July 1996, as a result of which she was hospitalized. She has been subject to continuous threats and intimidation, apparently because of her work on behalf of the Tepoztlan community. She now fears for her life and that of her son, and has decided to leave Tepoztlan.
