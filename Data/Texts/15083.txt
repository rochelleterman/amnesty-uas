 Reports of arbitrary killings in the town of Kulp continue to reach AI. The reports indicate that a military operation similar to the recent destruction of Sirnak (see EUR 44/85/92) is underway. The use of tanks and guns against the civilian population of the town was first reported at 1 pm local time, 3 October. Telephone lines were reportedly cut. A military vehicle had apparently been fired upon by PKK guerillas and an armed clash ensued in which two soldiers were killed and eight wounded. The security forces then reportedly fired at random; property has been damaged, civilians killed and wounded and scores of people detained. Access to and from Kulp is prohibited. Five people are reported killed, including Vahit Narin, allegedly doused with petrol and set alight. "
