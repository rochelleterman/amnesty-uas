 Mexico: Fear for safety / possible extrajudicial execution | Amnesty International 
 Members of the OCSS: AI is seriously concerned for the safety of members of the Southern Sierra Peasant Organisation, Organizaci«n Campesina Sierra del Sur (OCSS), following the death of one of their leaders on 15 March 1998. Santiago Luna Reina was gunned down by an unidentified group of heavily armed masked men. AI fears that OCSS members may be subjected to further human rights violations by both members of the security forces and paramilitary groups acting with the complicity of the authorities.
