 Belarus: Death penalty / ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 On 12 March 1999, Dmitry Vyacheslavovich Yefremenkov and  Yevgeny Igorevich Voronezhsky,    were sentenced to death and to 22 years in prison for a murder committed in July  1998. Amnesty International is concerned that they were   found guilty after an unfair     trial on the basis of    confessions resulting from  ill-treatment in police       custody.
