 Replies from the Brazilian Government to AI members indicate that in April 1995 Wagner dos Santos was moved to a new hospital in April 1995. He now is staying at the Witnesses Safe House in Rio de Janeiro, where he has guards to protect him. As far as AI is aware, he is no longer receiving medical treatment. One side of his face is reportedly still paralysed since the attempt on his life in December 1994."
