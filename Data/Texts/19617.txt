 More than 130 people – crew members of at least nine ships – are being held hostage by pirates close to the coastal town of Eyl in the region of Puntland, northeastern Somalia. A number of the hostages are reported to have been injured during gun battles as the ships were seized and have not had access to medical care. According to the East African Seafarers’ Assistance Programme, there is insufficient food and water for the large number detained. "
