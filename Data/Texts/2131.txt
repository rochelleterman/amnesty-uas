 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Johannes Setlae, aged 26, who was assaulted and detained by the Bophuthatswana police on 12 January 1994. He was detained after police broke up a voter education meeting arranged by members of the local African National Congress (ANC) youth league. Johannes Setlae is an ANC committee member in Mogogoe village. He is believed to be held at Mmabatho police station under Section 25 of Bophuthatswana's Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite detention without charge."
