 There is grave concern for the safety of members of the non-governmental human rights organization MINGA, after a telephoned death threat was received at its headquarters on 18 August 1995. The threat comes shortly after the three people named above were detained by members of the Anti-Kidnapping and Extortion Unit (UNASE) on 4 August 1995 in Aguachica, department of Cesar. The three were later released after several hours."
