 Nineteen-year-old Jeffrey Franklin is charged with murdering his parents, Gerald and Cynthia Franklin, and with attempting to murder three of his siblings. The Madison County District Attorney's Office is intending to seek the death penalty against him in violation of international law, which forbids the use of the death penalty against those who were under 18 years old at the time the crime was committed."
