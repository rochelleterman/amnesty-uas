 Amnesty International fears that one of two Lebanese nationals, Ghassan Sa'id and Pierre Abu Joudi, members of the Lebanese National Resistance Front, could be subjected to torture and ill-treatment by the South Lebanon Army (SLA) or the Israeli security forces after being captured on 16 August 1998. The other Lebanese national, unknown which one, was reportedly killed by the SLA during the same operation.
