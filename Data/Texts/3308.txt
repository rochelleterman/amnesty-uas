 Around 65 people are being held incommunicado in the cities of Lubumbashi and Kinshasa, in connection with an alleged secession plot, by which the province of Katanga would declare independence from the rest of the DRC. A number of those detained are believed to have been tortured or ill-treated and are being denied access to medical attention.
