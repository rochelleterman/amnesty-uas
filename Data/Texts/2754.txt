 The students, Hassan Ali, Mohamed Siddig, Omar al-Amin, Mohamed al-Mustafa Hashem, Ammar Najm al-Din, Taher Bashiri, Sami Yousef Ismail, and seven other students are being detained incommunicado and are at risk of torture. They were among scores of students detained after a wave of violent clashes between security forces and student demonstrators at a number of universities in Sudan, during which at least three students died.
