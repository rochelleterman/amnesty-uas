 Turkey: Prisoners of Conscience / Unfair Trial | Amnesty International 
 Mehmet Desde, Mehmet Bakir, HÅseyin Habip Taskin, Maksut Karadag, Serafettin Parmak, Metin ªzgÅnay, ªmer GÅner and ErgÅn Yildirim are facing imminent imprisonment, solely for their non-violent political beliefs. All the men were convicted following an unfair trial, largely on the basis of statements allegedly extracted under torture. If the eight are imprisoned, Amnesty International will consider them to be prisoners of conscience.
