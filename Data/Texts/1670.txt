 There is concern at reports that four supporters of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) arrested on 4 August 1995 remain detained without charge. It is believed that they may be prisoners of conscience and that they may face ill-treatment and harsh conditions in detention. They are believed to be held at a military camp in Afam. According to the Military State Administrator the men have been arrested in connection with the May 1994 murder of four Ogoni leaders. However, unofficial sources suggest that they have been arrested for making contact with MOSOP leaders currently on trial in Port Harcourt. Some women supporters of MOSOP were also reportedly arrested, apparently for communicating human rights concerns to foreign human rights investigators."
