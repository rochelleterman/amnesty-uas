 The Director of the Ministry of Information and Culture in the Maldives has responded to AI's concerns about the arrest and detention of the two men named above. The reply, dated 14 June, states that they have been taken into custody ""on charges of having contravened the law"" and that ""investigations into their case are underway"". AI remains concerned that they may be prisoners of conscience and is still concerned about their health. The two men have now been in police custody for more than 45 days, the maximum period in law for people to be kept in police custody."
