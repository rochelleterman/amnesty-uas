 Croatia: Further information on fear for safety: Ivan Z Cicak and other human rights defenders; and new attack on workers at the Vrhovine advice centre | Amnesty International 
 On 22 November 1996, arsonists attacked the offices of the humanitarian assistance centre in Vrhovine in the former United Nations Protected Area. The building was set on fire but, as it was empty at the time, no one was hurt. Although attacks against the building are being investigated by the Croatian authorites, Amnesty International continues to be concerned about attacks on human rights defenders in Croatia.
