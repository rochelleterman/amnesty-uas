 At the end of December 1993, the Special Investigations Unit of Procurator General's Office recommended that disciplinary charges be brought against military officers involved in the killing of the 13 people named above on 5 October 1993. However, the charges refer only to false statements and attempts to conceal the massacre, despite strong evidence of direct military involvement. AI is concerned also about the dismissal of the military judge assigned to investigate the case: the judge was informed of his dismissal at a meeting attended by one of the officers implicated in the massacre."
