 The five people named above have been placed under house arrest: along with at least five other members of the non-violent Agzybirlik political opposition movement, they were placed under 24-hour house arrest on 2 December 1992. All were still under house arrest as of 7 December. The arrests seem to be related to their attempting to attend a human rights conference in Kyrgyzstan. The first four named above had previously been under house arrest at the end of October 1992, after meeting or trying to make contact with AI representatives (who were expelled from Turkmenistan). Agzybirlik has tried three times to register officially but each time members have been threatened with arrest if they meet for the necessary constituent assembly. "
