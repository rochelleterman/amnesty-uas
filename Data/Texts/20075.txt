 NA 
 On 21 May, Indigenous farmer, Oscar Reyes, was killed, and three other farm workers were injured, while tending crops in the Valle del Polochic, in Panzos, north-eastern Guatemala. In March, local indigenous communities were evicted from the land, over which a local company claims ownership. They are at grave risk of being attacked for continuing to cultivate the land."
