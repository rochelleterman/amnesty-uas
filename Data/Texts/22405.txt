 Iraq: Detainees held incommunicado risk torture | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Thirty-six Iranian men who were arrested from Camp Ashraf in July have been transferred from a police station to a military airbase in Baghdad. Fears for their safety remain as they are now detained incommunicado and are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. By continuing to detain them the Iraqi authorities are contravening a judicial order calling for their release."
