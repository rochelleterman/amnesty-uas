 Colombia: Fear for safety / possible ""disappearance"": Luis Bolivar Lopez | Amnesty International 
 There is grave concern for the safety of Luis Bolivar Lopez who has not been seen since 3 April 1997 when witnesses reportedly saw him being forced into a car in Ibague, department of Tolima, by a group of armed men. Luis Bolivar was formerly a member, now demobilized, of the M-19 guerrilla group, who was amnestied by the government in 1990.
