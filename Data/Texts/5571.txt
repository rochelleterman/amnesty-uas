 Jos√© Hass√°n Rojas may be facing imminent execution. The   Supreme Court is now considering a final appeal, lodged   by his mother: if it upholds the sentence, he could be    executed at any time. 

He was reportedly sentenced to death in July 2000, for a  murder committed in November 1998. He has consistently    maintained his innocence. Prison doctors have told his    mother that he gouged out both his eyes in protest at the sentence, and she says he is now totally blind."
