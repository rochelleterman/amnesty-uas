 Iran: Torture/Imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Seventeen Kurdish and Arab activists, imprisoned for opposing the Iranian government, have all been sentenced to death and are reportedly at risk of imminent execution. One former Kurdish activist and refugee, who was forcibly returned from Turkey in 1998, and five members of Iran's Arab minority, have already been hanged, and it is feared that more executions may soon follow.
