 Iraq: Further information on Imminent execution/possible death sentence: Taha Yassin Ramadhan (m) | Amnesty International 
 Former Iraqi vice-president Taha Yassin Ramadhan was sentenced to death on 12 February by the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal (SICT). The case will be referred back to the SICT's Appeals Chamber. However, since it was the Appeals Chamber that requested his previous sentence of life imprisonment to be increased, he is at risk of being executed within 30 days.
