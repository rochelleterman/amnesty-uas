 Peasant leader Luis Olmedo Aguilera Lopez was reportedly detained on 24 February 1993 on charges of stealing cattle from a local landowner. He was reportedly taken to the Provisional Detention Centre in Quito and transferred to the Crime Investigation Office in Pichincha on 25 February. His relatives reportedly saw him at about 1pm on that day and he was allegedly unable to walk, having being severely beaten. He was apparently transferred back to the Provisional Detention Centre on about 2 March but was apparently taken to hospital the same day, where he died. A police autopsy report states that his body bore signs of bruising. "
