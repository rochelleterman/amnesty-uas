 NA 
 Nicholas Ingram, a British citizen, is scheduled to be executed in Georgia on 6 April 1995. He was sentenced to death for a murder committed during a burglary in 1983, when he was 19. He reportedly committed the crime during an alcohol-induced blackout. Ingrams claims that, due to alcohol-induced memory loss, he is unaware whether he committed the crime or not. There are also concerns about the quality of the evidence identifying Ingrams as the murderer: the description of him given by the survivor of the attack does not fit his appearance. His fingerprints were not found at the murder scene and when he was arrested his clothes bore no signs of violence or bloodstains."
