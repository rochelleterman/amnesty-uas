 UA 264/93 - Indonesia / East Timor: arbitrary detention / fear of torture: Martinho Rodrigues Pereira and two others | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Martinho Rodrigues Pereira, a former political prisoner, and two others were arrested by military intelligence forces on 5 July 1993. It is not known whether he has been formally charged, but he is understood to have been accused of assisting politically active East Timorese living in Indonesia. In particular, he is thought to have been accused of orchestrating a recent asylum bid by seven young East Timorese. There is concern that they may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment while under interrogation in incommunicado detention. "
