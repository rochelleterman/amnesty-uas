 Walter Blair is now scheduled to be executed on 21 July 1993. This is despite new evidence that casts serious doubt upon his conviction. Walter Blair, black, was sentenced sentenced to death in 1980 by an all-white jury. It is alleged that his original trial was tainted by racial prejudice. A clemency petition is currently before Governor Carnahan. "
