 Cambodia: Fear of forced eviction/health concern | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Around 32 families living with HIV and AIDS are facing forced eviction from Borei Keila, central Phnom Penh. The families have protested at their planned resettlement to a site 20 kilometres from the capital, where they would have no means of income; lose access to medical treatment; and go without basic services. Despite protests, the local authorities have said the eviction will take place in May 2009. "
