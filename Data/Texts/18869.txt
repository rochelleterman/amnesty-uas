 Algeria: ""Disappearance"" / fear for safety / legal concern: Rachid Medjahed | Amnesty International 
 Rachid Medjahed (alias Khaled Abou Mouaad), an ex-member of a town council representing the now banned Front Islamique du Salut (FIS): Amnesty International has learned with concern that Rachid Medjahed, who was arrested on 12 February, is still being held in secret detention, in violation of Algerian law. He appeared on television on 23 February and confessed to being a member of an armed group and having planned and directed the killing of Abdelhaq Benhamouda, a trade union leader. Since that day neither his family nor lawyers have been able to ascertain his whereabouts and there are serious fears for his safety.
