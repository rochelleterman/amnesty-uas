 Russian Federation: Further information on possible prisoner of conscience / fear of death penalty: Alexander Nikitin | Amnesty International 
 AI continues its investigation into the circumstances of Alexander Nikitin's arrest, including studying the environmental report concerning the Northern Fleet. If he was arrested solely on the grounds of his research on behalf of the Norwegian environmental group Bellona,  AI will consider him to be a prisoner of conscience. AI is also concerned about other environmental activists being harassed.
