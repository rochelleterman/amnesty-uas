 Mohammad Akbar Hajam, Mohammad Ramzan Rather: The above, both members of Jamaat-e-Islami, a political opposition group, have not been seen since 17 July when they were arrested by members of the army in Dangerpora, Jammu and Kashmir. They were travelling on a bus which was stopped by members of the 9th Gorkha Regiment. The two men were taken away to the army camp. Although this was witnessed by other passengers, army officials denied that the above were in their custody or that they had been arrested.
