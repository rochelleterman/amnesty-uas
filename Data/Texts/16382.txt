 Croatia: Fear for safety: Ivan Z Cicak and other human rights defenders | Amnesty International 
 AI fears for the safety of the above and other human rights defenders in Croatia. On 18 July, a bomb was detonated 20 metres from Ivan Z Cicak's house in Sumartin on the island of Brac. AI believes that he was targeted because he is president of the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, a prominent NGO which is openly critical of the Croatian Government's human rights record.
