 Maldives: Further information on fear of torture/fear for safety, Mohamed Nasheed | Amnesty International 
 Mohamed Nasheed was sentenced to two and a half years' banishment on 8 November after a short trial. He was not allowed to have a lawyer represent him, or to speak in his own defence. He was found guilty of the theft of unspecified ""Government Property"". The charges may have been politically motivated. Amnesty International therefore believes that he may be a prisoner of conscience and is investigating the charges against him and the fairness of his trial.
