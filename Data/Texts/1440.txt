 At least 50 people, perhaps as many as 300, arrested since 24 October 1995 are being held incommunicado. They include members of the security forces as well as civilians.  AI is concerned for their well-being and believes that they may be prisoners of conscience.  Arrests are reported to be continuing.  None of the detainees is known to have been charged with any offence though they are alleged by the government to be members of an intelligence network providing information about strategic installations to the Iraqi secret services."
