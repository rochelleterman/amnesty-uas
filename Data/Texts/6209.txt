 Guatemala: Fear for safety/death threats: Marielos Monz√≥n (f), journalist: Gabriel Mazzarovich (m), journalist

 | Amnesty International 
 Journalists Marielos Monz¢n and Gabriel Mazzarovich have been subjected to death treats and intimidation, in what appears to be an effort to force them to stop reporting on demonstrations by groups including farmers, indigenous communities and teachers, who say the recently ratified Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) will destroy their livelihood. The police and army are alleged to have used excessive force in response the demonstrations. Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the journalists' safety.
