 There is concern that demonstrators in the Serbian town   of Leskovac on 6 July 1999 were beaten and detained by    riot police following their calls for the release of      imprisoned technician Ivan Novkovic and an end to the     repression of news media. Ivan Novkovic, who works for a  television station, was sentenced to 30 days in prison on 5 July 1999 for arranging an anti-government protest      without giving advance warning to the authorities.
