 Geoffrey Kuria Kinuthia has apparently not received medical treatment for acute typhoid (typhoid is reportedly rife in Nakuru prison). Stefan Kariuki Muigai has reportedly received medical treatment for injuries resulting from torture following a court order on 16 November 1993. The trial date of Koigi wa Wamwere and the five others charged with him has been set for 14 December 1993. John Kinyanjui is expected to be released shortly, after his bail was reduced from 500 000 Kenyan shillings."
