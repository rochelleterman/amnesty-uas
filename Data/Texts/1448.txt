 Fifty-two of the people arrested since 24 October, including one woman and seven military officers, have been charged with membership of an illegal association and creating a new political movement contrary to the law. The more serious charge of providing information to a foreign power has been dropped. They are due to appear before a Correctional court imminently. The defendants' lawyers have been denied access to the legal dossiers and some of the accused have made statements that they were tortured during interrogation."
