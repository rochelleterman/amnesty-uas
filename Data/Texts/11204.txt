 UA 132/92 - India: ""disappearance"": Ashaq Hussain Ganai | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ashaq Hussain Ganai has not been seen since he was reportedly taken away by soldiers on 3 March 1993 during a cordon and search operation. His family have made persistent inquiries about him and requests to see him in custody, which have been refused. On 21 March his family house was searched. Later that day they were told that Ashaq Hussain Ganai would be released on 25 March but later again on the same day they were told that he had ""escaped"". There are grave fears for his safety. Mr Ganai has raised the case with the new Governor of Jammu and Kashmir and other officials but so far without success. "
