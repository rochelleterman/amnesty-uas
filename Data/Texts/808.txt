 Ethiopia:  Fear of torture / Excessive use of force by security forces | Amnesty International 
 A number of school students have been shot dead and hundreds arrested since 25 March 2002, as police used live ammunition to disperse anti-government demonstrations in southern Ethiopia which are still continuing. Amnesty International is concerned that the arrested students, some of whom may be prisoners of conscience, may be ill-treated or tortured, and may be held for a long time without charge or trial.
