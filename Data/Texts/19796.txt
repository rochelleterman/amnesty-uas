 NA 
 Emmanuel McKenzie is Chairman of the Millarâ€™s Creek Preservation Group which held a fundraising event on April 19 2008. He and his organization have been targeted by the Bahamian security forces who have also accused him of illegal activities in an attempt to discredit him. Amnesty International believes that this harassment may be linked to his environmental activism."
