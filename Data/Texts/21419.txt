 Russian soldiers seized the two women named above during  a raid on a house in the Chechen village of Serzhen-Yurt  on 9 November. The soldiers threatened to rape and kill   five girls who were sleeping in another room of the       house. Amnesty International fears the two women's lives  are in danger, and that they are at risk of torture and   ill-treatment, including rape, in custody."
