 Prominent human rights activists in Nigeria are being repeatedly harassed and detained as protests mount against the government's failure to adhere to plans for a return to civilian rule. Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti, Chairman of the Campaign for Democracy and President of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, was arrested on 6 July at his home in Lagos. This was his third arrest in the space of a few days. An associate, Tunji Thomas, was arrested at the same time, but later released. Femi Falana, a lawyer and a leading member of the Campaign for Democracy and President of the National Association of Democratic Lawyers (NADL), and Chief Gani Fawehinmi, a prominent human rights lawyer, and also a member of the Campaign for Democracy were both arrested on 7 July 1993.
