"Turkey: Further information on prisoner of conscience: Osman Murat Ulke 
 NA 
 Osman Murat Ulke continues to be tried for his refusal to perform military service. On 19 December he was released by the military court in Ankara, but was immediately rearrested for ""continuing to disobey orders"". On 27 December 1996 he was again conditionally released by the Eskisehir Military Court after his trial was adjourned. There remains concern that he faces rearrest and possible imprisonment as a prisoner of conscience.
