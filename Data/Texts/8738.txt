 UA 77/93 - USA (Texas): death penalty: Gary Graham | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Gary Graham, black, is scheduled to be executed in Texas on 29 April 1993 for a murder committed when he was 17. If carried out, this will be the sixth execution of a juvenile offender in the USA since the reinstatement of the death penalty. His appeal lawyers have argued that he was inadequately represented by his trial lawyers who failed fully to explore alibi evidence. His counsel apparently failed also to uncover evidence of possible brain damage found later in a psychiatric examination. His appeal has been rejected but his lawyers continue to investigate alleged discrepancies in the evidence on which he was convicted, in support of a possible innocence claim. "
