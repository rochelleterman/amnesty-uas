 Democratic Republic of Congo: Arbitrary arrest / Fear of  torture, N'sii Luanda Shandwe,  human rights activist. | Amnesty International 
 Human rights activist N'sii Luanda Shandwe has been arrested in the capital, Kinshasa. Neither friends nor family have been allowed to see him, and Amnesty International believes he is at serious risk of torture and ill-treatment. It would appear that he was arrested solely because of the authorities' intolerance of human rights activists.
