 AI remains concerned for the health of the above, a student activist, who is still in police detention at Police Resort, Central Jakarta. He was injured and arrested during a demonstration in protest at the use of excessive force by the security forces during student riots in Ujung Pandang on the island of Sulawesi in April 1996. He is the only individual still in police custody as a result of the demonstration and claims that his involvement in the demonstration was entirely peaceful.
