 NA 
 It is feared that Cengiz Uguz and the 27 people detained with him may be interrogated under torture at the Anti-Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters, after a lawyer at the State Security Court confirmed that the police were given permission to hold the above for 15 days on the suspicion of PKK membership. Cengiz Uguz detained on 11 October 1992 was held for five days in incommunicado detention without authorization or registration. "
