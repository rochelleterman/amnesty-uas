 Fears for prisoners on death row in Indonesia have been greatly increased by executions of two prisoners in January 1995. Kacong Laranu, who had been sentenced to death for murder in 1986, was executed on 31 January. Chan Ting Chong, sentenced to death for heroin smuggling in 1986, was executed on 13 January. His was the first execution in Indonesia for drug-related offences. AI fears that the risk of imminent execution of others who have had their appeals for clemency rejected has now greatly increased."
