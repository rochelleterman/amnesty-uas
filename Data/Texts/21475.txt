 Russian Federation (Chechnya): Further Information on fear for safety/ torture/ incommunicado detention/ enforced disappearance: Makhmadsalors Delilovich Masaev (also known as Mukhamadsalakh Masaev) (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned that Makhmadsalors Delilovich Masaev has been subjected to enforced disappearance and is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. He was abducted on 3 August 2008 in Grozny by men in camouflage uniform. There are grounds to believe that the abductors were Chechen law enforcement officials. Amnesty International is concerned that he has been detained in order to punish him for seeking redress and for speaking out about his unlawful detention for four months between 2006 and 2007."
