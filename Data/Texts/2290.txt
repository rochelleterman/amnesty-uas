 South Africa (Bophuthatswana): Further information on fear of extrajudicial execution: Solomon (Solly) Bokaba | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Solly Bokaba is still being targeted for harassment by the Bophuthatswana Police, as the President of the Students Representative Council (SRC) at the University of Bophuthatswana (UNIBO). On 22 July he was arrested with seven other UNIBO students. In an intentionally rough journey in the back of the police van injuries which he had received during an earlier assault by police officers on 7 May were made worse. He was then held in solitary confinement at Temba Police Station and forced to sit on the cold stone floor during interrogations causing him added pain. All eight students were released on 26 July and charged under the Bophuthatswana Internal Security Act, apparently for their student activities."
