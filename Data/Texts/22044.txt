 Iran: Medical action: Akbar Ganji | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Investigative journalist Akbar Ganji, 45 years old, has been on hunger strike for over five weeks in protest at being denied access to medical care for chronic asthma, despite a specialist's recommendation that he be treated outside the prison. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for his peaceful criticism of the authorities and is calling for his release. In the mean time it is seeking assurances that he will receive whatever medical care his doctors prescribe."
