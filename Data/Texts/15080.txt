 Mehmet Balamir, a distributor for the newspaper Ozgur Ulke, was detained at a road block on 5 September 1994 and detained by members of Pirinclik Gendarmerie Station. The Regimental Gendarmerie Headquarters in Diyarbakir have confirmed that he is in custody, but have not disclosed his whereabouts. Later the same day the newspaper's office in Diyarbakir was raided and the office manager, Kadriye Ozcanli, detained. Her detention at Diyarbakir Regimental Gendarmerie Headquarters has also been confirmed. There is concern that both may be tortured during interrogation."
