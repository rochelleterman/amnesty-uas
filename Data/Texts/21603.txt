 On 14 June, Lithuania's Parliament voted to overturn the Presidential veto of the “Law on the Protection of Minors against the Detrimental Effect of Public Information”.  The law institutionalizes homophobia and violates the right to freedom of expression and the right to be free from discrimination. It will now enter into force on 1 March 2010."
