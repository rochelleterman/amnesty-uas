 India / Bhutan: Further information on imminent extradition / fear of torture: Rongthong Kunley Dorji | Amnesty International 
 There remains concern that Rongthong Kunley Dorji, a 58-year-old Bhutanese national, may be at risk of extradition to Bhutan where he could be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. He is the chairman of the United Front for Democracy (UFD) in Bhutan, a political organization in exile, and was arrested by police at its offices in New Delhi on 18 April. Concern for his safety has been heightened by reports that four people associated with him were arrested in early February 1997 in eastern Bhutan and tortured. The four, Taw Tshering, Tshampa Wangchuck, Tshampa Ngawang Tenzin and Chhipon Samten Lhendup, continue to be held at Tashi Yangtshi prison.
