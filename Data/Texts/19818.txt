 State parliamentarian Marcelo Freixo and his aide Vinicius George are at risk of being assassinated by milicia groups in Rio de Janeiro. Plans were discovered by police when they raided a milicia group in May 2009 and found letters from the head of a milicia in Rio das Pedras requesting support from another milicia group to assassinate the two men.
