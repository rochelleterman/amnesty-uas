 UA 277/93 - Tunisia: fear of torture: Samir Moussa, Mohamed Tahar Badi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern that the above two men are being held in incommunicado detention and may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment. Samir Moussa was arrested on 25 July 1993 on arrival at Tunis airport. Police told his family that he was being held for routine checking, and would be promptly released, but despite repeated inquiries, they have been unable to obtain any information as to his whereabouts and legal status. Mohamed Tahar Badi was arrested from his home on 28 July 1993, and was not allowed to take with him medicines for a kidney problem. Formerly a commander in the anti- riot squad of the security forces, he was suspended from administrative duties after his daughter was sentenced in absentia last year for membership of an illegal organization.
