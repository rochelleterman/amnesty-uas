 Pakistan: Fear for safety for Bakhtwar (18) | Amnesty International 
 The family of Bakhtwar, an 18-year-old woman who married  without    her parents' consent, are holding her prisoner  and have  forced her to divorce. Amnesty International    fears that   they may kill her to avenge the perceived    slight to their honour. Scores of women are killed every  year in Pakistan in such ""honour killings"".
