 There is continued concern that the draft law against forced ""disappearances"" which was approved by the Colombian Congressional House of Deputies and Senate on 7 and 8 June 1994 will be rendered ineffective if presidential objections to the law are upheld. In a statement issued on 21 July President Gaviria failed to withdraw his objections to the law and instead made clear his intention to ratify the Inter-American Convention with reservations. On 27 July a congressional commission was set up to examine the President's objections and has just under three weeks in which to present its conclusions."
