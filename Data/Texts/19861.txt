 Canada: Possible prisoner of conscience: Matthew Lowell (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 28 October 2008, the Canadian authorities are scheduled to deport US serviceman Matthew Lowell to the USA. He fled to Canada in October 2004 because of his conscientious objection to the war in Iraq and his objection to serving in the United States army. If deported to the USA, he risks being court-martialled and imprisoned for between one and five years and would therefore be a prisoner of conscience."
