 UA 321/92 - Colombia: fear of ""disappearance"": Jhon Fredy Triana Beltran | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Jhon Fredy Triana Beltran, a 17-year-old school pupil, has not been seen since 13 October 1992, when he was reportedly detained by six individuals believed to be members of the security forces in Villavicencio, Meta department. Relatives managed to trace the vehicle in which he was allegedly taken away to the premises of UNASE, a specialized anti- kidnapping unit, in Villavicencio. However, UNASE officials deny knowledge of his detention. The day before his detention, the family home had been searched by armed forces personnel who reportedly confiscated a radio used by the family to communicate with farm workers. "
