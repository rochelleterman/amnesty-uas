 Ablikim, Alim and Rushangul Abdiriyim, the three adult children of ethnic Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer were reportedly detained by the police in May in Urumqi, the regional capital of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR). They were forcibly escorted to a camp site called Nansan where Ablikim Abdiriyim and Alim Abdiriyim were severely beaten by police officers. Ablikim lost consciousness and was taken to hospital for medical treatment. They reportedly remain in police custody, although their exact whereabouts and state of health are unclear. Amnesty International fears they are at risk of further torture or ill-treatment.
