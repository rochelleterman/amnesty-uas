 AI fears that 75 Palestinians arrested over the last week are at risk of being tortured during interrogation by the GSS. According to an Israeli army spokesman, the 75 detainees, reportedly members of the Islamic opposition group Hamas, were arrested on suspicion of planning attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers. AI has previously condemned arbitrary and deliberate killlings of civilians by Hamas."
