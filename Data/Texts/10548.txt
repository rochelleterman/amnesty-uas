 Khin Maung Win alias Ko Sunny, Cho Aung Than, Daw Khin Ma Than (f) alias Nge Ma Ma Than, U Shwe Myint Aung alias Myint Swe, U Myo Aung Thant, U Khin Kyaw: U Shwe Myint Aung was not released as reportedly previously, and he, his wife Daw Khin Ma Than and her brother Cho Aung Than, were sentenced to ten years' imprisonment on 15 August at a court inside Insein Prison. They were sentenced under the Unlawful Associations Act and the Emergency Provisions Act, both of which have often been used to hand down long-terms of imprisonment for peaceful political activity. There are no further details about their case and there is concern that they may not have received a fair trial.
