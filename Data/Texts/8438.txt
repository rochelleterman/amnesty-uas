 Trinidad and Tobago: Death Penalty/Legal Concern: Sean    Parris

 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that Sean Parris has   been charged with a crime that carries a mandatory death  sentence without having being provided with legal         representation. As a result of his lack of legal          representation, there are fears that Sean Parris could be at risk of ill- treatment in detention.
