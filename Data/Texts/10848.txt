 China: Further information on Fear of forcible return
 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is deeply concerned that Shaheer Ali, a member of the Uighur ethnic group from the Xinjiang Autonomous Region (XUAR) in northwest China, has reportedly been executed after being forcibly returned to China from Nepal last year. There are concerns for the safety of Kheyum Whashim Ali, Abdu Allah Sattar and other Uighurs who have also been forcibly returned to China after seeking asylum in Nepal and elsewhere.
