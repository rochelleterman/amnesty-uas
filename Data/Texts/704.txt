 NA 
 AI is concerned about Alfredo Bijuan, in hiding following reports that the security forces have instructions to kill him. He is a member of the Union de Trabajadores y Estudiantes (UTE) in Bata and was prominent in a student demonstration in Bata on 24 November 1992. Forty students were arrested in connection with the reportedly peaceful demonstration. All were reportedly tortured, some severely. They included a woman who was eight months pregnant. They were released on the evening of 24 November. Scores of arrests of suspected dissidents have been reported. At least one person has been reportedly extrajudicially killed by the security forces in the past week. "
