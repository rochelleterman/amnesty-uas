 Magda Maguina, a 14-year-old schoolgirl, from the district of Muguiyauyo, Jauja province, Junin department, was reportedly detained by security forces on 10 March 1993. On 7 April her mother, following denials from the military and police authorities that she was in their custody, filed a complaint about her daughter's disappearance before the Public Ministry's Office for the Defence of the People and Human Rights, in Huancayo. On 12 April during a raid on a house in the Chilca neighbourhood in Hunacayo, eight heavily armed plainclothes men, allegedly one of whom belonged to the Peruvian army, were accompanied by a girl whose description matched that of Magda Maguina. Witnesses further claim that the girl told them to say that she was being held by the Intelligence Service. "
