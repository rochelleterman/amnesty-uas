 On 17 November the prosecution asked for a death sentence to be imposed on prisoner of conscience Ahn Jae-ku, currently on trial before Seoul District Criminal Court on charges under the National Security Law. The court's verdict is expected on 30 November. Since 17 November Ahn Jae-ku has been forced to wear handcuffs 24 hours a day. This is believed to be an arbitrary additional punishment which accounts to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. He is currently in poor health, suffering from arthritis and rheumatism. Twenty-two others are also on trial, including 66-year-old Yu Rak-jin and Ahn Jae-ku's son, Ahn Young-min, also adopted as prisoners of conscience."
