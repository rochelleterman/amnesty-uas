 Felix Mponda Phiri, a freelance journalist arrested on 2 January 1993, was reportedly released on bail after appearing in court on charges of possession of an unauthorized publication. No date has yet been set for his trial. No information is available about his treatment but he appears to be in reasonable health. His detention seems to have been illegal as it exceeded the legally permitted period of 48 hours in which a person can be held without charge. "
