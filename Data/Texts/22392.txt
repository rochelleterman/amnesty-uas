 Iraq: Camp residents beaten and tortured | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Thirty-six Iranians detained in Iraq are being held at a police station. Iraqi security forces detained the Iranians when they forcibly seized control of Camp Ashraf. Most are reported to have been beaten and tortured after their arrest and at least seven need urgent medical care. They are said to be on hunger strike in protest against their detention and treatment. All 36 detainees remain at risk of being forcibly retuned to Iran where it is feared that all or some of them could be at risk of torture or execution."
