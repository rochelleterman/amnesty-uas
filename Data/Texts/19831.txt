 Federal police officers attempting to detain indigenous chief Rosival Ferreira da Silva, known as ´""Babau,"" have used excessive force against his family and other members of the Tupinambá community of Serra do Padeiro in the state of Bahia, raising fears that if he is arrested he will be tortured. His brother Jurandi was detained and beaten on 23 October 2008, and the situation in the region is very tense."
