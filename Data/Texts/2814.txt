 Sudan: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/incommunicado detention/detention without charge/ possible prisoners of conscience, Fathi Mohammad al-Hassan. | Amnesty International 
 Fathi Mohammad al-Hassan, a member of the Sudanese Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, is being detained incommunicado at an unknown location and has reportedly been tortured. Amnesty International fears that he may be detained solely on account of his political affiliation, and he may therefore be a prisoner of conscience.
