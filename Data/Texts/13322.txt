 Singapore: Death Penalty: Took Leng How (m) | Amnesty International 
 Malaysian citizen Took Leng How, aged 22, who was sentenced to death in August 2005, has had his final appeal rejected by the Court of Appeal. The President still has the power to grant clemency. Took Leng How's lawyers are currently preparing a clemency appeal: for maximum impact they have asked that all UA network appeals should arrive by 11 May, before they submit the appeal to the President.
