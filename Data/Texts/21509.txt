 Russian Federation: Ingushetia: Doctors publicly branded as terrorists: medical action | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Fourteen women doctors in the Russian Republic of         Ingushetia have had their pictures distributed by the     Russian authorities on posters, in the media and on the   Internet along with allegations that they are ""planning   terrorist attacks"". Such allegations are highly damaging  and could put the physicians' lives at risk. AI is urging the Russian federal authorities to ensure that all the    relevant agencies and authorities are informed of the     women's innocence and instruct them to remove the         pictures from public display, websites etc. to prevent    further publication in the media and that the security of the women is guaranteed."
