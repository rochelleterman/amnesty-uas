 Three military policemen have been charged and await trial for the killings, and another has now been detained. Child witnesses are reportedly being recalled to take part in a further face-to-face identification procedure in court on 23 May 1994. Initial protection has now been withdrawn, and at least three of the child court witnesses are back on the streets, together with a further 48 other possible witnesses. Several of the children have received death and bomb threats from members of the military police. The Rio de Janeiro authorities have failed to provide secure accommodation for the witnesses, despite the threat of legal sanction, after a Civil Public Inquiry made recommendations calling for the urgent implementation of such a plan."
