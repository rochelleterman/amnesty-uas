 Nepal: Fear for safety / possible 'disappearance' | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of the two lawyers named above who were both reportedly arrested at their homes at around 11pm on 21 February. Their families have not been informed of their whereabouts. These two men appear to have been arrested because of their involvement in the defences of people arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and Punishment) Act (TADA).
