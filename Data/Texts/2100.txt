 AI is gravely concerned about the above-named trade union and ANC officials in the Esikhaweni-Empangeni area of northern Natal who are potential targets of a hit squad with links to Kwazulu police. They are believed to have assassinated NUMSA shop steward and ANC member Samuel Nyawo in August 1992 as well as attacking the home of Bheki Ntuli and carrying out other attacks on the same night. Three men were arrested in October 1992 and charged with five counts of attempted murder. Despite the seriousness of the charges they were released on bail, on condition that they reported to the police every day. While out on bail, the men have allegedly committed other murders and attempted murders, as well as intimidating potential witnesses at their trial. "
