 Iran: Arbitrary arrest/fear of torture and ill-treatment, Yousuf Azizi Bani Toruf | Amnesty International 
 Writer and journalist Yousuf Azizi Bani Toruf was arrested on 25 April at 2pm, after he returned from a press conference where he spoke in support of anti-government protestors. Seven or eight members of the security forces in plain clothes came to his home and took him away; they told his wife they had an arrest warrant, but refused to present it. Amnesty International fears he may be tortured to force him to confess.
