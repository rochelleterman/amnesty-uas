 Sudan: Act now to end the human rights crisis in Darfur | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The latest evidence from Darfur, western Sudan, reveals a population in crisis. An estimated one million people     have been forced to flee their homes. More than 10,000    have been killed. Human rights violations are being       carried out on a massive scale by the Janjawid, a         government-backed militia, which often operates alongside government troops."
