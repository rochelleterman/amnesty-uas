 UA 342/93 - Brazil: torture / fear of ""disappearance"": Osorio (second name unknown) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A rural worker known only as Osorio has ""disappeared"" after being taken into police custody and tortured. He is believed to have been detained on 7 September 1993 during a police operation to arrest peasants suspected of involvement in the murder of a landowner and a veterinarian in the south of Para state. Other detainees at the police station say that he was in poor health as a result of the beatings. A lawyer seeking information on his whereabouts has found no official record of his detention or judicial order for his arrest. "
