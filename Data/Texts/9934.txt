 USA (Alabama): Death Penalty: John W. Peoples Jr, white (m) | Amnesty International 
 John W. Peoples Jr. is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection in the State of Alabama on 22 September. He was sentenced to death in January 1984 for the murder of Paul and Judy Franklin and their son, Paul Jr, in Talladega County. There are doubts about the competency of the lawyer who represented him at the trial at which he was convicted. His alleged accomplice was convicted of the same murders but sentenced to life imprisonment.
