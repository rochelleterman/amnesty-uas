 Iran: Prisoner of conscience/Torture: Abbas Lisani (or Leysani)  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Prisoner of conscience Abbas Lisani was moved to a new prison on 6 March 2008 so that his flogging sentence can be carried out. He is now in imminent danger of being flogged, which is cruel and inhuman treatment amounting to torture; Iran is a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which expressly prohibits torture."
