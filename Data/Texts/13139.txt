 UA 227/93 - Philippines: fear of ""disappearance"": Robin Trosing, Diorito Trosing | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Robin and Diorito Trosing ""disappeared"" after being taken for questioning by military officials and members of an official militia group on 31 May 1993 in Palapag town, Northern Samar. The two men, both farmers, were reportedly arrested by members of the 19th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army and of the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Group (CAFGU). After the arrest, relatives and local government officials were assured that the two would be returned home soon. However, the next day, they were informed that the two detainees were no longer in the same place, and had been accused of being supporters of the New People's Army (NPA). Soldiers subsequently claimed the two men had escaped, but their fate and whereabouts remain unknown. "
