 Germany: Fear of imminent refoulement: Fariz Simsek, rejected Kurdish asylum-seeker | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Free State of Bavaria is persisting with plans to return Fariz Simsek, a Kurd, to Turkey, where he would be at risk of human rights violations. This is in spite of a moratorium on the deportation of Kurds, which applies to all states within the Federal Republic of Germany, including Bavaria. Fariz Simsek has been repeatedly detained and threatened by the security forces in Turkey. His health is reportedly poor as a result of severe torture in detention in Turkey. He reportedly suffered two heart attacks in prison and has had two operations. He is described as being currently depressed and highly suicidal. AI is appealing for him not to be returned to Turkey."
