 USA (Texas): Further information on Death penalty / Legal concern: Lonnie Earl Johnson (m) | Amnesty International 
 Lonnie Johnson, black, aged 44, was executed in Texas on 24 July. He had been sentenced to death in 1994 for the murder of two white teenagers, Gunar Nelson Fulk and Leroy McCaffrey, in 1990. The courts refused to stay the  execution to examine claims that the prosecution had      withheld evidence at the trial supportive of Lonnie       Johnson's claim that the shootings were committed in      self-defence.
