 China: Ill-health, Li Wangyang, prisoner of conscience: Medical action | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Li Wangyang, a prisoner of conscience in Chishan Prison   in Yanjiang city, Hunan Province, is reportedly seriously ill. Prison authorities have reportedly denied him        medical treatment. His sister, Li Wanglin, was sent to a  labour camp for three years in July 2001 for publicly     supporting her brother in his appeal for compensation for the abuses he had allegedly suffered in prison. Amnesty   International has issued appeals on Li WangyangÂ’s behalf  in 1998 and 2001 and is renewing its call for action,     including for his sister Li Wanglin."
