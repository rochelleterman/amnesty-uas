Sergei Gurgurov (m)
 | Amnesty International 
 Sergei Gurgurov, aged 27, is reportedly being denied the medical treatment he urgently requires for injuries sustained during torture and ill-treatment at the hands of police. Despite a court decision on 3 November that he should be transferred to house arrest, the police have brought new charges against him and continue to detain him. He may be at risk of further torture or ill-treatment.
