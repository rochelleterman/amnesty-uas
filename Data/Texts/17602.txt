 On 6 April 1994 in Afula, the seven people named above were killed and about 50 others wounded, when a car bomb exploded next to an Israeli school bus. The attacker was also killed in the explosion. The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), is reported to have claimed responsibility, describing it as retaliation for the Hebron massacre. There are fears that Hamas may carry out further reprisal killings against Israeli civilians."
