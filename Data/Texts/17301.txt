 Iran: Further information on: Medical concern/Fear for safety/incommunicado detention, Akbar Ganji | Amnesty International 
 Prisoner of conscience Akbar Ganji has reportedly ended his two-month hunger strike. His wife, Massoumeh Shafii, was allowed to visit him on 21 August in the Milad hospital in the capital Tehran for the first time in almost three weeks. She said that Akbar Ganji was in ""fair health"" and was eating soup and stewed fruit. He is at risk of being returned to Evin prison when he leaves hospital, to serve the remainder of his six-year sentence. He is still demanding his unconditional release.
