 Tunisia: Further information on possible prisoner of conscience / fear of unfair trial and new legal concern: Najib Hosni | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Najib Hosni, a human rights lawyer arrested on 15 June 1994, continues to be detained without trial, in excess of the maximum period of 14 months allowed under Tunisian law. He should therefore be immediately tried or released. Since January 1995 he has not received any visits by his lawyers because of conditions that he be submitted to body searches. It is still believed that he is being detained for his work as a human rights lawyer and that he may be a prisoner of conscience."
