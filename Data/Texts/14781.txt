 On 23 June 1993, 13 of the detainees were released. They reported that Ethem Elma, Savas Dortyol, Meltem Onder and Gulay Yucel were in a very bad condition as a result of heavy torture. The remaining detainees, including Savas Dortyol, who suffers from a heart condition, and Kamil Gulbagm who suffers from epilepsy, continue to be held incommunicado at Istanbul Police Headquarters, where it is feared they are being interrogated under torture.
