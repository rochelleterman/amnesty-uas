 Mr Satyavan, a truck driver aged 35 from Jharoda Khalan village, is reported to have died, allegedly as a result of torture in Najafgarh police station in Delhi on 2 March 1993. Mr Satyavan, an alleged drug addict, was first arrested on 25 February 1993 and released two days later, apparently after his family had paid a large sum of money to the police. Villagers allege that he was rearrested when his relatives failed to meet demands from the police for more money. The Sub-divisional Magistrate and the police's vigilance branch have reportedly begun inquiries into his alleged torture and death. AI is calling for an independent and impartial inquiry. "
