 United Kingdom: Health concern: Mahmoud Abu Rideh (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Palestinian refugee Mahmoud Abu Rideh, who is the subject of a ""control order"" imposed by the UK government, attempted suicide in May and is now in a critical condition in hospital. He has been refusing food since his suicide attempt, and on occasion has also refused liquids. His lawyers believe there is a real risk that he will attempt suicide again unless the control order is lifted, or at least relaxed."
