 The 25 people named above are reported to be among at least 60 people arrested in East Timor since early November 1992. They were reportedly arrested in Manatuto and Same districts and in East Timor's capital Dili. They are believed to be detained in military detention centres in Baucau, Same and Dili but their precise whereabouts are not known. Human rights violations have accompanied a recent crackdown by Indonesian security forces, which coincides with the anniversary of the November 1991 Santa Cruz killings and with the capture of the East Timorese resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao, on 20 November 1992. AI fears that those named above could be at risk of torture or ill-treatment in incommunicado detention. "
