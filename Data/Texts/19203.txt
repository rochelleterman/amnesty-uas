 Tunisia:  Further information on  fear for safety/prisoner of conscience: Sihem   Ben Sedrine				 | Amnesty International 
 Prisoner of conscience Sihem Ben Sedrine appeared before the examining judge for questioning on 5 July. The approximately 200 lawyers could assist as the courtroom was too small. The defence lawyers decided to leave the court in protest against this restriction of the right of defence. Sihem then exercised her right to silence during the hearing. No new date has yet been set for Sihem's questioning. Amnesty International remains concerned for her safety in custody.
