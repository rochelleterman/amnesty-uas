 Bangladesh: Torture | Amnesty International 
 Two senior members of Bangladesh's main opposition party, Bahauddin Nasim (m) and Dr Mohiuddin Alamgir (m) from the Awami League, have reportedly been severely tortured in police and army custody. They appear to have been arrested on politically motivated grounds. There are strong fears that they may be at risk of further torture. Dr Mohiuddin Alamgir has reportedly been denied medication for his diabetes, without which he may become gravely ill and eventually go into a coma.
