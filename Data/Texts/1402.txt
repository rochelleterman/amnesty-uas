 UA 193/94 - Mali: legal concern / probable prisoners of conscience / health concern: Diallo Fanta Drame, Korotoumou Traore | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The two women named above were arrested in Bamako on 11 and 12 May 1994 and are being unlawfully held incommunicado and without charge. It is believed they could be prisoners of conscience, detained solely becuase of their involvement in a peaceful campaign seeking the release of students accused of participating in violent demonstrations on 15 February 1994. Diallo Fanta Drame is a member of the Association des victimes de la repression, an organization working for the victims of government repression before the coup of March 1991. She is diabetic and suffers from high blood pressure and stomach pains, but has reportedly been denied medication and treatment. Korotoumou Traore is a member of the Association des partants volontaires a la retraite, an organization working for retired people."
