 Russian Federation: Prisoner of conscience / health concern: Yury Shadrin | Amnesty International 
 Yury Shadrin, a human rights advocate, was arrested on 29 November in the Siberian city of Omsk on the order of the Regional Procurator and he was later charged under three articles of the Russian Criminal Code relating to charges brought against him between 1992 and 1996. It is believed that these charges are without foundation and that he was arrested to prevent him from participating in the Congress of the Russian judges on 5 December. After his arrest Yury Shadrin declared a hunger-strike and his health is reported to be deteriorating. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience and his calling for his immediate and unconditional release.
