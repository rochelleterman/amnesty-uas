 UA 369/94 - Indonesia: imminent arrest as prisoner of conscience: Dr George Aditjondro | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 5 October 1994 police issued a warrant for the arrest of Dr George Aditjondro, a prominent academic at Satya Wacana University. He is charged with insulting a government official. The pretext for the charge appears to arise from comments he made during a panel discussion at the Islamic University of Indonesia in August 1994. During the discussion Dr Aditjondro, among others, commented on the question of the Presidential succession. AI believes that the arrest may be an attempt to punish him for past criticism of government policy on human rights and the environment and, further, to prevent him from taking part in peaceful activities before and during the APEC meetings in Jakarta in mid-November."
