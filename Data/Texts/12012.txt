 Eight former student activists, arrested on 12, 13 and 14 February, have been denied access to lawyers and family since their arrest. AI fears that they may be tortured and forced to make incriminating ""confessions"". The organization fears that they may be prisoners of conscience. The eight were doing compulsory military service when they were detained. They are currently held for interrogation at the Military Security Command headquarters in Seoul. They are believed to be accused of forming a pro-North Korea organization, Chajudaeok, while at Pusan University. Five students from Pusan University are being held at Pusan police station."
