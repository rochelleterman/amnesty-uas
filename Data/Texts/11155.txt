 Members of the family of Rupesh Singh, who allegedly died as a result of police torture, have reportedly been threatened by the police, in order to make them withdraw the case they have brought against the police. The case was filed in January 1993. Shortly afterwards a member of the police reportedly came to their house and abused them. On 13 February a police officer allegedly offered them money to withdraw the charges. "
