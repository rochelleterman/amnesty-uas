 NA 
 Shabir Shah, a leader of the People's League, was arrested on 12 May 1995 by members of the security forces, and is reportedly being held incommunicado at Hari Niwas interrogation centre. There are fears he may be in danger of torture or ill-treatment. Given his previous arrests and imprisonment, there is concern that he may once again have been detained for political reasons, and that he may be a prisoner of conscience."
