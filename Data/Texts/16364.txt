 Bosnia-Herzegovina: Further information on fear for safety: Non-Serbs in Bosnian Serb-controlled areas | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Human rights abuses continue in areas away from the frontline in Bosnia-Herzogovina despite moves towards a comprehensive ceasefire. Recently reported abuses against Muslim and Croats in areas of northwest Bosnia-Herzogovina under Bosnian-Serb control include ill-treatment, forcible expulsions, arbitrary detention of men of military age, abductions, as well as allegations of unlawful killings and rape. There is particular concern for the safety of the remaining non-Serb population following the arrival of paramilitary troops in the area organized by Zeljko Raznatovic. Representatives of UNHCR have expressed concern about expulsions."
