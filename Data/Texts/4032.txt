 NA 
 Democlides Albuquerque Carneiro, a 23-year-old Macuxi Indian, arrested on suspicion of having stolen some cattle, was reportedly shot dead on 6 November at the Alto Alegre police station. A forensic examination concluded that the shot had been fired from some distance, and not in a tussle as police originally stated. Civil and federal police inquiries have reportedly been opened into the killing and the policeman who confessed to the shooting has been detained in custody. On 3 November police are alleged to have entered the Macuxi village of Lilas setting fire to a house and a cattle pen, and severely beating two indians. They were apparently acting on behalf of a land claimant in dispute with the Macuxi."
