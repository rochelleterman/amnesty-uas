 AI is concerned about reports from Gore town in southern Chad that members of the Republican Guard are carrying out indiscriminate mass killings in Gore and villages in the surrounding area. The Ligue Tchadienne des droits de l'homme has reported that since 21 January 1993 at least 45 people, including women, children and religious leaders, have been killed, apparently in reprisal for insurgent activity in the area. Houses have reportedly been burned and villages shelled. "
