 Guinea: Death Penalty/fear of imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Executions have resumed in Guinea after more than 15 years. Twenty-two people are now awaiting execution. It is not known whether they have exercized their right of appeal to a higher court. If any judicial appeal is turned down, they may also petition the President for clemency. Amnesty International is concerned that their death sentences may be confirmed if they do, in which case they may be executed at any time.
