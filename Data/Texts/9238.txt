 EXTRA 45/94 - USA (Nebraska): Harold Lamont ""Wili"" Otey | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Harold ""Wili"" Otey, black, is scheduled to be executed in Nebraska on 2 September 1994. He was sentenced to death in 1978 for the rape and murder of a white woman. The Nebraska Board of Pardons denied him clemency in June 1991. Otey's attorneys have since argued that his clemency hearing was unfair on the grounds that the state Attorney General, who prosecuted the case both personally and through the Attorney General's office and who has actively sought to expedite Otey's execution, also serves on the Nebraska Board of Pardons."
