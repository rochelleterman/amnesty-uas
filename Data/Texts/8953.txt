 EXTRA 29/94 - USA (Washington): death penalty: Charles Campbell | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Charles Campbell, white, is scheduled to be executed in Washington on 27 May 1994. He was sentenced to death in December 1982 for the murders of two white women and a child. His appeal was rejected by a narrow majority of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in April 1994. In it's ruling, the court lifted a stay of execution in effect since March 1989, allowing Campbell's execution to be carried out within 42 days, as opposed to the usual 90 days. He may still seek a stay of execution from the US Supreme Court, but it is considered unlikely that any appeal for a stay would be granted."
