 Mexico: Legal concern/ harassment: Angel Mario Ksheratto Flores (m) | Amnesty International 
 Angel Mario Ksheratto Flores, a journalist from Chiapas State, southern Mexico, was re-arrested on 4 February for reportedly breaking bail conditions imposed after he was charged with defamation in 2003. Amnesty International believes that his re-arrest may constitute judicial harassment, and that his case fits a pattern of intimidation of journalists with the intention of restricting freedom of expression.
