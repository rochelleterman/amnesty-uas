 Turkey: Further information on Fear for safety / risk of torture and ill-treatment / possible extrajudicial execution | Amnesty International 
 Adil Kiliç, Kasim Kiliç and Resit Kiliç, who were detained by gendarmes during a 17 October raid on their home, have been remanded to Silvan prison. They had reportedly been tortured. The other 22 members of the Kiliç family detained during the raid have been released. Mesut Kiliç, who apparently witnessed the killing of Selma Kiliç during the raid, was detained on 19 November and is at risk of torture while in police detention. Reports received by Amnesty International strengthen the fear that Selma Kiliç was the victim of an extrajudicial execution.
