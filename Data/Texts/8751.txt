 NA 
 On 8 April 1994 a bill which would reinstate the death penalty for as a possible sentence for persons over 18 for specific types of intentional premeditated murder passed the Kansas House of Representatives and the state Senate. The bill is expected to go to the state governor for action on 14 April. The governor, a Catholic who opposes the death penalty, then has 10 days to respond. If she takes no action the bill will become law without her signature. Governor Finney has indicated that she may let the bill become law without her signature as she believes that this is the will of the people."
