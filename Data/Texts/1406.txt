 AI is concerned about the killing of at least 17 Tuareg civilians by the Malian army in recent weeks. No independent inquiry appears to have been ordered into the killings nor any legal proceedings initiated against any of those responsible. Twelve Tuareg were reportedly killed in Menaka, northern Mali, on 21 April 1994, including a woman aged 70. At least 20 others were reportedly injured. They were shot reportedly in reprisal for the killing of two soldiers. On 10 May five Tuareg were reportedly killed in Dire by soldiers who reportedly opened fire without warning."
