 AI is concerned about further reports of deliberate arbitrary killings of Muslim civilians in Gorazde. Bosnian Serb forces reportedly attacked the main hospital in Gorazde on 19 April 1994 and again on 20 April, killing 10 patients and wounding 15. Up to 28 people, mainly patients, were killed in another attack on 21 April. Other civilian targets shelled include residential buildings near the hospital, refugee centres and aid agencies."
