 Mexico: Fear for safety/ Prisoner of conscience/ Unfair trial | Amnesty International 
 Prisoner of conscience and renowned environmental activist, Felipe Arreaga was arrested on 3 November 2004 by judicial police in town of PetetlÊn in Guerrero State. He faces an unfair trial for a murder committed in 1998. Amnesty International fears that Felipe Arreaga's arrest and the issuing of arrest warrants against 14 former members of the OCESP is a reprisal against the organization for previous environmental activism. It may also be designed to deter the work of his wife, Celsa Valdovinos, who leads the Organizaci¢n de Mujeres Ecologistas, Women's Environmentalist Organization and that of other environmentalists in the Guerrero state.
