 Human rights defender Halil Savda was detained at 6am on 24 February while visiting the eastern Turkish city of Doğubeyazıt. He is now in prison in the city, and has been ordered to serve a 100-day prison sentence handed down in 2008, for speaking publicly about his support for conscientious objectors. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression. "
