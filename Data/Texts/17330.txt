 Iranian Arab refugee Sa'id 'Awda al-Saki was reportedly arrested in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on 11 May, apparently at the request of the Iranian authorities. He was reportedly forcibly returned to Iran three days later, and is now held incommunicado at an undisclosed place. Amnesty International fears he may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment, and of being sentenced to death.
