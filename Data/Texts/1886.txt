 Rwanda: Further information on: fear for safety / fear of ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Celestin Kayibanda, prosecutor of Butare, Fidele Makombe, prosecutor of Kibuye: Celestin Kayibanda, who was arrested on charges of genocide and murder, has not yet been formally charged. He was reportedly transferred to Nyanza prison and AI has not received any reports that he is being ill-treated. Fidele Makombe was suspended from his functions as prosecutor shortly after giving an interview to a French radio journalist in which he talked about his being beaten by a soldier. His suspension may also be connected with the fact that he had refused to carry out arrests on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations.
