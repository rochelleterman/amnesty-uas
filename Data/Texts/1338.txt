 UA 26/93 - Malawi: fear of ill-treatment / legal concern: The Reverend Peter Kaleso | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Reverend Peter Kaleso, a minister of the Church of Central Africa (Presbyterian) and an official of the opposition AFORD party, was arrested in Lilongwe on 24 January 1993 after speaking at an AFORD rally. AI considers him to be a prisoner of conscience and is concerned for his well- being. He has not so far been charged with any offence although he has been held beyond the legal maximum of 48 hours, after which a prisoner must be charged or released. He has reportedly been allowed only brief access to his familiy and lawyer. Reverend Kaleso has been arrested before for his criticisms of the government. "
