 NA 
 Yuri Melini has been shot by masked men, apparently in connection with his work as Director of the Centre for Environmental, Social and Legal Action. Amnesty International believes he, his family and colleagues are in grave danger. Other human rights defenders working on environmental concerns and focussing on similar issues to CALAS have also been threatened. "
