 Human rights activist Azer Ramizoglu Samedov, an Azerbaijani citizen, was arrested in Georgia on 31 March at the request of the Azerbaijani authorities, who have asked for him to be extradited. He has been free on bail since 14 April, but could be detained and forcibly returned at any time. In Azerbaijan he would be at risk of torture and ill treatment. Georgia has ratified the Convention Against Torture, which expressly prohibits the forcible return of anyone to a country where they would be at risk of torture.
