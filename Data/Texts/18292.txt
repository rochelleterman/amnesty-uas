 Saudi Arabia: Fear of increase in executions | Amnesty International 
 Sarah Dematera, Filipino, and others on death row: There is concern that at least 11 people have been executed in the past four days, bringing to 16 the total number of executions this year. The exact number of prisoners on death row is unknown and there are fears that these executions may mark the beginning of a spate of executions. Unconfirmed reports suggest that a Filipino national, Sarah Dematera, is currently on death row, reportedly convicted of the murder of her employer in 1992. Her execution has reportedly been suspended until the victim's oldest child comes of age and decides whether to accept blood money instead of her execution.
