 | Amnesty International 
 On 22 February a US court martial sentenced Mark Wilkerson to seven months' imprisonment and discharged him from the army for bad conduct and for going absent without leave (AWOL) from a second tour of duty in Iraq. Amnesty International considers Mark Wilkerson to be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for his conscientious objection to participating in the war in Iraq. He should be released immediately and unconditionally.
