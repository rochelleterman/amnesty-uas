 Adzhik Aliyev, an Islamic scholar (Mullah), was sentenced to death on 25 August 1993 by the Supreme Court of Tadzhikistan. The Chairman of the Supreme Council, Imamali Rakhmonov, has reportedly not yet turned down a petition for clemency, but has been quoted as stating that Adzhik Aliyev was a personal enemy and was not going to live. Sources in Tadzhikistan believe the execution could take place as soon as 18 October. "
