 On 30 March 1993 at least 40 children and adolescents, inmates at the State Foundation for the Welfare of Minors were subjected to beatings and other forms of ill-treatment after a riot which was quashed by a joint force of FEBEM's security personnel, military police and private security guards. Conflicting reports of the numbers injured were received from two different official sources. Witnesses denouncing the beatings and ill-treatment may be subjected to reprisals. "
