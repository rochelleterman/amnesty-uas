 The Syrian authorities are reportedly holding British citizen Hilal Abdel-Razaq Ali without charge or trial, in an attempt to force a relative who is apparently wanted for committing a ?breach of national security? to give himself up. The authorities deny having him in custody, and he is at risk of torture.
