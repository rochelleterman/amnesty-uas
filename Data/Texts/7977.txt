 UA 206/94 - Peru: ill-treatment / fear for safety: Cesar Flores Gonzales | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Cesar Flores Gonzalez has told an Amnesty International delegation visiting Peru that on 30 April he was detained by a military patrol in the twon of Huanta, Huanta Province, Ayacucho department, and beaten before being released on 6 May. He is now afraid to return to Huanta, where he works as a correspondent for Radio Antena 1. His detention and ill-treatment seem to have been in reprisal for his public denunciation that he had been threatened with death by a military officer a week prior to his detention."
