 NA 
 Primary school teacher Dante Valdez was attacked on 13 August 2008 by a group of about 30 people who burst into a local school in Madera, Chihuahua state, where he was taking part in a teacher training course. The attackers, most of whom work for a local mine, pushed and kicked him, and told him to stay out of their business. Amnesty International has been informed that as of yet no police investigation has been initiated into the attack. "
