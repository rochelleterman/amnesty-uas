 Bahrain: Health and legal concern / fear of forcible exile: Nazi Karimi (f) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There are fears for the health of Nazi Karimi, a 29-year-old university student, who is being held without charge or trial in Madinat 'Issa. She is anaemic and has reportedly been on hunger-strike since her arrest on 9 April 1995. She is said to be in very poor health. She is being held in a solitary cell and has reportedly been put under pressure to sign a ""confession"" stating that she took part in recent protests. For 18 days after her arrest she was held incommunicado. She is also reportedly under threat of forcible exile."
