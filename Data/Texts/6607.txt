 There is concern for the safety of Dra. Brenda Merida who has been receiving anonymous threats since April 1993. She is the doctor and director of a rural medical centre in Santa Eulalia, Huehuetenango department. It was established in order to improve health care in the area, and is situated on land previously occupied by the local office of the Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil, Civil Defence Patrols (PAC). It was only with the support of the local military that the PAC agreed to move from the land. Another worker at the medical centre, an Italian doctor named Emanuela Saggi, has also been harassed. "
