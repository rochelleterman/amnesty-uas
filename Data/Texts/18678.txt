"Syria: Medical Concern: Riad Seif (m) 
 Syria: Medical Concern: Riad Seif (m) | Amnesty International 
 The Syrian authorities have refused to allow former risoner of conscience Riad Seif to leave the country for  medical treatment. He has prostate cancer, which has advanced to a stage where it is liable to start spreading to other parts of his body without specialist treatment, which is only available outside Syria. Amnesty            International considers Riad Seif's travel prohibition a  form of punishment based solely on his non-violent        exercise of his right to freedom of expression.
