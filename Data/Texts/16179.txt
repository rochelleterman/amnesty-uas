 Turkmenistan: Fair trial concern / fear of death penalty | Amnesty International 
 On 30 November 1998, possible prisoners of conscience Mukhametkuli Aymuradov and Khoshali Garayev, face a closed trial for new charges brought against them, including one of organizing an attempt on the life of the President of Turkmenistan which carries a possible death penalty.  Amnesty International is extremely concerned that they may not receive a fair trial.
