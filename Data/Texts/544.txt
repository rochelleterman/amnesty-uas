 The above-named members of the Chadian National Army were arrested over the last few weeks and are believed to be held at Moundou military barracks. Three of them were reportedly beaten after arrest. The men are reportedly being held incommunicado and there are fears for their safety. The first three named above appear to have been arrested on suspicion of having links with the rebel CSNPD; the reasons for Joachim Nodjihorkem's arrest are not known. "
