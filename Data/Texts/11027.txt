 NA 
 Chen Ziming, a 43-year-old prisoner of conscience suffering from cancer, began a hunger strike in Beijing Prison No. 2 on 13 October 1995 in an attempt to persuade the authorities to provide him with proper medical care and to unblock his bank account to allow him to pay for his medical expenses. His wife, Wang Zhihong, was arrested on 22 October while holding a peaceful protest calling for medical treatment for her husband."
