 China: Fear for safety/ possible incommunicado detention: Gao Zhisheng (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng has not been seen since 22 September 2007. His family has been unable to confirm his whereabouts. It is possible that Gao was detained by members of the State Security Bureau, but the Chinese authorities have made no official announcement of his detention. Amnesty International is concerned that Gao Zhisheng's safety is at grave risk.
