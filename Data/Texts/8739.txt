 EXTRA 20/94 - USA (Florida): death penalty: Roy Stewart | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Roy Stewart is scheduled to be executed in Florida on 20 April 1994 despite doubts about his guilt of the crime for which he was sentenced. According to his current attorney, he was convicted on his own confession, which he retracted at trial, and the testimony of a witness who has since recanted. His lawyers claim that he confessed under police pressure and because of his disturbed mental state. New evidence has also come to light since his clemency hearing in 1983."
