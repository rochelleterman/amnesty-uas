 Nevzat Ersonmez was killed on 27 February 1995 at about 2am. His body was left in a sack in front of the minibus company for which he had worked. The doctor who examined his body reported burn marks and marks of a rope around his neck. He had apparently been deprived of food and water. Nevzat Ersonmez had previously been detained by members of the Anti-Terror Branch in January 1995 and questioned about the owner of the minibus company, Salih Genc, who was killed in early February."
