 Sudan: Fear for Safety/Fear of Unlawful Killings | Amnesty International 
 Janjawid militias attacked eight villages and a camp of displaced people in the Jebel Moon area of West Darfur on 29 October, leaving at least 67 men, women and children dead. Other Janjawid attacks, including killings and abductions, have taken place in other parts of Darfur. Local inhabitants say the Janjawid are gathering in Sawani and Goz Banat, areas close to Jebel Moon, apparently in preparation for further attacks. Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of civilians who have fled the area, and of other villagers in West and North Darfur States.
