 Iran: Further information on arbitrary arrest/fear for safety/possible prisoners of conscience 		


 | Amnesty International 
 Most of the followers of Shi'a cleric Ayatollah Sayed Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi arrested since 28 September are believed to have been released, some on bail. However, the Ayatollah himself and at least 22 of his followers are still detained in Section 209 of Evin Prison. There are unconfirmed reports that Ayatollah Sayed Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi may have suffered a heart attack and been hospitalised for some days. He is now believed to be in Evin Prison, where it is feared he may not be receiving adequate medical treatment.
