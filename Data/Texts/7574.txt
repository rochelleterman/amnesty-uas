 Mexico: Medical concerns/ fear for arbitrary detention/ forced evictions | Amnesty International 
 In the early morning of 18 August, six Indigenous families were forcibly evicted from their homes in the settlements of Nuevo San Manuel and Buen Samaritano, which are in the Montes Azules nature reserve, Chiapas state. The group comprises 39 people: six men, seven women and 26 children. The men are held in a prison in the nearby city of Tuxtla Gutierrez, while the women (two of whom are pregnant) and children remain in police custody in inadequate conditions. There are concerns for the health of the group, who appear to be detained arbitrarily.  Other communities settled in the nature reserve may also be evicted in the coming days.
