 Sudan: Fear of Imminent Execution / Legal concern: Nagmeldin Abdallah (m)
 | Amnesty International 
 Nagmeldin Abdallah, aged 17 may be executed at any time for the murder of a trader in the town of Al-Damazin, Blue Nile State, eastern Sudan. He was 15 years old at the time of his arrest. This contravenes Sudan's obligations under international law, which prohibits the use of the death penalty against those who were under 18 at the time of the crime.
