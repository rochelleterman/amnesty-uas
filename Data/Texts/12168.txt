 Antonio Ti Luo, an ethnic Chinese national of Bolivia, is currently being detained in Macau, and is at serious risk of imminent extradition to the People's Republic of China, where he may be tried and executed for alleged economic offences. At a preliminary hearing in November 1993, the Macau High Court decided to allow his extradition. This decision was reportedly endorsed by the Governor of Macau on 2 January 1994."
