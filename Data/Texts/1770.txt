 Zimbabwe: Fear of imminent execution / death penalty: Mrs Sukoluhle Kachipare | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that mother of two,    Sukoluhle Kachipare, could face imminent execution by     hanging. She was sentenced to death after being convicted in March 1997 of inciting her maid to murder her (the     maid's) new-born baby. She was convicted primarily on the maid's testimony.
