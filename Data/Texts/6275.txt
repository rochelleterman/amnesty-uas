"Guatemala: Death penalty 
 Guatemala: Death penalty | Amnesty International 
 Pedro Castillo Mendoza, Roberto Giron: AI is deeply concerned that the first executions in Guatemala for more than 12 years may be imminent. The above, who were convicted of raping and killing a four-year old girl, have had their appeal against their death sentence turned down by the Constitutional Court. All legal remedies have now been exhausted and their only hope for clemency is a presidential pardon. AI is concerned by a recent statement on these cases made by President Arzu to the national press, in which he is reported to have said that he will respect the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice and that the death penalty will be applied.
