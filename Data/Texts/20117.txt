 Guyana: Further information: Tortured Guyanese man may face unfair trial | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A 20-year-old man held incommunicado at a police station in Guyana has been released without charge, and a 15-year-old boy receiving hospital treatment for torture suffered in police custody in the same case is no longer a suspect. However, another man, Deonarine Rafick, may face an unfair trial after being tortured in order to force him to sign a confession.   "
