 Syria: Further information on fear of torture/incommunicado detention/prisoners of conscience/unfair trial | Amnesty International 
 Mahmoud 'Issa and Michel Kilo were brought before the Criminal Court in Damascus on 31 October to face new charges brought against them that month. They appealed against the new charges, and the case was adjourned. The Court of Appeal has rejected their appeal, and a new trial date will be set in January. Khalil Hussein and Suleyman Shummar, who were released on 25 September, are believed to be still in imminent danger of arrest on the same or similar charges as Michel Kilo and Mahmoud Issa. Anwar al-Bunni appeared before the Criminal Court on 19 December on charges of disseminating false information deemed to be harmful to the state, and forming an international group without government permission.
