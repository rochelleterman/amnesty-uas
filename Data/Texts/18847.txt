 Mohammed Benmarksi, a taxi driver who had worked with a number of foreign journalists in Algeria, was arrested and taken from his home on 8 April 1995 at around 2.00 am by members of the security forces who presented themselves as ""journalists"". Since then, his family has been unable to obtain any information about his place of detention or the reasons for his arrest. Mohammed Benmarksi had recently been questioned by security forces in a hotel in Algiers, where he had been to see a foreign journalist. He had also appeared in a foreign television program testifying to human rights violations by the security forces."
