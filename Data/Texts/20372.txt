 Inhabitants of town Santo Domingo Ixcatl√°n, in Oaxaca state, are apparently under siege from a group of armed men working for a local political boss (cacique) closely connected to the municipal authorities. For many months, the group has been threatening and intimidating members of the community who oppose the sale of communal lands. Three community members opposed to the sale were killed in April 2008. The sale of those lands would bring profit to the municipal authorities and the local political boss."
