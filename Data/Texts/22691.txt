 The writer and peaceful advocate of reform in Syria, Fayez Sarah was arrested on 3 January 2008 and is now reportedly being held incommunicado without charge at the State Security branch in Damascus. His detention brings the number of recently arrested political activists currently being held by State Security to eight. They are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Amnesty International considers them to be possible prisoners of conscience, detained solely for their peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association."
