 There is growing concern for the safety of the civilian population of Kabul after a renewed bombardment of the city in recent days. According to reports, between 11 and 13 November at least 57 unarmed civilians were killed and over 150 injured when rocket and artillery barrages fired from Taleban positions south of Kabul pounded the city. AI is once again urging the Taleban and all other warring factions to refrain from attacks against the civilian population of Kabul."
