 There have been reports that at least 12 people have been killed and at least 50 injured during demonstrations, following a strike, in Kathmandu and neighbouring towns between 25 and 28 June 1993. There have also been reports of mass arrests of as many as 300 people, including Prem Parajuli, a human rights activist with the Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC). Many of those arrested have now been released, but unofficial sources say that 134 remain in detention, and that they have been ill-treated and tortured by police during interrogation. With the exception of Prem Parajuli, all those named above are known to have died. One of those killed, in the town of Patan, was Rita Silpakar, a 24-year-old housewife, who had merely watched the demonstration from the window of her house nearby. "
