 The above-named have all been released. Mehmet Gokalp, representative of the Human Rights Association in Derik, was reportedly beaten severely in detention and also tortured with electricity. The other named detainees were apparently treated similarly. Mehmet Gokalp has been charged with breaching the law on demonstrations; he has prepared a formal complaint about the torture he allegedly suffered in detention. He has tried to be examined by a doctor but apparently the local doctor was too afraid to examine him. "
