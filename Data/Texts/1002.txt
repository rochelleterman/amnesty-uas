 Amadou Oury Bah was released on 29 October 1992. He had apparently been arrested on the basis of a prisoners' testimony which alleged that he had been involved in an attempt to assassinate President Lansana Conte on 12 October. The testimony was later withdrawn and there was no evidence against him. He was released shortly after a demonstration organized to protest against his arrest. "
