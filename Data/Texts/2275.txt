 Michael Mathe was transferred on 5 May 1994 from Alberton Police Station to the nearby Natalspruit hospital, and has since been released on bail. His mental state was apparently disturbed further when his brother, Morgan Mathe, a local monitor for the National Peace Secretariat, was shot in the face by armed men, and is in a critical condition in Natalspruit hospital. The police and prosecutor have not presented in court a detailed charge sheet against Michael Mathe, and no trial date has yet been set. Michael Mathe has laid a charge of assault against officers who allegedly tortured him in January."
