 Burundi: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/Prisoner of conscience, Etienne Ndikuriyo | Amnesty International 
 Journalist Etienne Ndikuriyo was arrested on 14 June, after he published an article saying the president suffered from depression. He is held at the Documentation nationale (the national intelligence agency) in the capital, Bujumbura, where he is at risk of torture or ill-treatment. He appears to be a prisoner of conscience, arrested solely for his legitimate work as a journalist.
