"Burundi/Tanzania: Refoulement / extrajudicial executions / fear of refoulement / fear for safety: Burundi refugees 
 NA 
 There is grave concern at the extrajudicial execution of 122 of the 126 Burundi refugees forcibly returned from Tanzania on 10 January 1997 and shot by Burundi government soldiers the same day. The killings heighten fears for the safety of other Burundi refugees in Tanzania who may face refoulement, in the absence of any safeguards.
