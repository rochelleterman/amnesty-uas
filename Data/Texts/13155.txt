 There is continued concern for the safety of Clovis Nazareno, a 33-year-old poet and journalist, whose articles are frequently critical of government policies. The latest attack occurred on 14 June 1993 in Poblaciona, a barangay (local administrative unit) of Loon, Bohol province, when he was seriously assaulted by a local businessman in the presence of a police inspector, who is also the municipal chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP). Clovis Nazareno was then detained, but was eventually taken to hospital and released. He filed a complaint against the two men on 22 June, but his case was dismissed in late July 1993 after two of his witnesses refused to testify for fear of reprisals. "
