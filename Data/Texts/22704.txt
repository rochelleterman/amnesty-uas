 NA 
 Mustafa Jum’ah, Kurdish political activist and prisoner of conscience, is now being detained at ‘Adra prison in the capital, Damascus. He had been kept in incommunicado detention for almost a month following his arrest by Military Intelligence officers on 10 January 2009. Amnesty International considers that Mustafa Jum’ah is no longer at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. However, the organization will continue to follow the case closely."
