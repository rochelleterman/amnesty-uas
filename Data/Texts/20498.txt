 USA: Ill-treatment/ health concern/ legal concern | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Approximately 50 detainees held in military custody at the US Naval Base in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, are currently on hunger strike. The majority of the hunger strikers are being force-fed by the GuantÃ¡namo authorities. The force-feeding methods may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In addition, Amnesty International is concerned by reports of the use of excessive force against hunger strikers when being extracted from their cells, and the blanket use of the restraint chair during force-feeding, even in the case of detainees who do not resist.
