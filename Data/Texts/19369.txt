 Yemen: Death penalty/legal concern, Yahia Hussein al-Dailami | Amnesty International 
 Cleric Yahia al-Dailami was sentenced to death on 29 May. It has recently become clear that his trial fell short of international standards of fairness. Amnesty International believes he may be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely because of his criticism of the government.
