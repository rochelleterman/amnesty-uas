 Bernard Amos, black, is scheduled to be executed on 8 October 1992. The is the third execution date that he has received this year and it is thought likely that the execution will go ahead. If carried out, this would be the 11th execution in Texas this year and the 26th in the USA; both figures represent record numbers of executions for any one year since the reinstatement of the death penalty. Leonel Herrera's case is at present under review by the Supreme Court. "
