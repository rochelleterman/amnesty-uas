 Peru: Further information on death penalty: proposed extension of death penalty laws | Amnesty International 
 On 11 November, a draft law to increase the sentences for those convicted under the 1992 terrorism legislation was submitted for consideration by the Peruvian Executive to Congress. The draft bill regulates the enforcement of the death penalty in cases of terrorism recognised in article 140 of the 1993 Constitution. The draft bill proposes to enforce the death penalty against those convicted of belonging to the leadership or being members of an armed opposition group involved in the killing of defenceless population, and to those convicted of terrorism related offences who re-offend.
