 Tal al-Mallohi, a 19-year-old Syrian woman, has been held incommunicado at a State Security branch in Damascus for nearly nine months. Amnesty International believes she may be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of expression. She is at grave risk of torture and other ill-treatment. "
