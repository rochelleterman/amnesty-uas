 USA (Arizona): death penalty: Luis Mata | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Luis Mata, of Mexican origin, is scheduled to be executed in Arizona on 12 July 1995. He was convicted by a jury and sentenced to death by a judge in 1977 for the murder of a woman. He was granted a resentencing hearing which was heard by the same judge, who again passed the death sentence. Mata's present attorneys state that the judge in question is currently under investigation for derogatory racial remarks made in another case. During Mata's case he allegedly used the term ""wetbacks"". Mata reportedly received poor legal representation at his trial, resentencing and appeal; his counsel failed to present evidence of his severely deprived family background, mental problems, low IQ and alcohol and substance abuse."
