 Colombia: Fear for safety: members of the Asociacion de Familiares de Detenidos y Desaparecidos (ASFADDES) | Amnesty International 
 On 24 June 1997 a bomb exploded in the building housing the regional office of ASFADDES in Medellin, Antioquia department. No members of the human rights organization were hurt, although several other people in the building at the time were injured. It is believed that this attack is the latest in series of attempts to intimidate it into halting its human rights activities at a time when several crucial cases of ""disappearance"" are coming to court. There is grave concern for the safety of all ASFADDES members.
