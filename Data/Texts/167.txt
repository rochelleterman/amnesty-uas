 Burundi: Arbitrary arrest / fear of torture / possible prisoner of conscience: Madame Solange Ndikumana (f) | Amnesty International 
 There is concern for the safety of Madame Solange Ndikumana, an employee of the Ministry of Finance, who was arrested in Bujumbura on 7 March 1997. She is being held at Mpimba prison, after initially being taken to the national intelligence unit, where she was allegedly tortured. It is believed she may be a prisoner of conscience, arrested because of her association with critics of the government.
