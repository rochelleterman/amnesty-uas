 There is concern for the safety of the ten Haitian asylum-seekers listed above following their repatriation by the United States Coast Guard on 26 February 1994. The first nine were reportedly arrested by the armed forces on disembarkation at Port-au-Prince. Moise Limage Josue was not held, but there are fears for his safety as he has been threatened, arrested and tortured in the past. According to reports the ten were among 141 people forcibly returned after being intercepted at sea. They had attempted to flee by a boat which left Port-de-Paix on 24 February."
