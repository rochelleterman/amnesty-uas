 There is concern for the safety of the two men named above who ""disappeared"" on 4 February 1994. They had reportedly set off that day to do some shopping in the village of Barranca, municipality of Colotenango, Huehuetenango department. Approximately half an hour later shots were heard, reportedly fired by members of the Patrullas de Autodefensa (PAC), Civil Defence Patrols from the village of Xemal. The two men have not been seen since."
