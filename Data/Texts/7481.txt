 Mexico: Fear for safety/Human rights defender | Amnesty International 
 The president of the Chiapas State Human Rights Commission, Pedro Raœl L—pez, has been suspended from his post by the State Congress, over allegations that he had obstructed investigations into the commission's finances. Amnesty International believes his suspension may actually be linked to his work investigating human rights violations by public officials in the state. He has been attacked and threatened before over his work in defence of human rights, and his family have also been intimidated so as to put pressure on him. Amnesty International is concerned for his safety and that of his family.
