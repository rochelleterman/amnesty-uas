 Noureddine Rahmoune and Ahmed Fodhil, both military personnel, were executed on 11 January 1992. They had been sentenced to death by the military court in Blida for participating in an attack on the Navy headquarters in Algiers. The case of Sid Ahmed Lahrani appears not to have been reviewed yet by the Supreme Court. These are the first executions known to have been carried out in Algeria since 1989. "
