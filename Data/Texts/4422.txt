 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of members of a peasant and farmers' union, the Sindicato de Campesinos y Agricultores de Guiaimaro - Salamina - Magdalena in the department of Magdalena. Wilson Monsalvo Navarro, vicepresident of the union, has received a series of verbal death threats in the past few weeks. Elmer Charris Alvarez and other members have been similarly threatened. The union is made up of around 50 families who occupy an area of land known as the Playones Baldios de Laura y Castro. Ownership of the land is claimed by a local landowner. Members of the union have been subjected to murder and harassment in the past."
