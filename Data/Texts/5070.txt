 The whereabouts of Luis Alirio Rodriguez Pineda remain unknown and there is continued fear for his safety and that of his wife Celina Franco, who was threatened at the time of his detention and who is now afraid to return to their home in San Pablo. Initial inquiries into his ""disappearance"" by the Colombian Presidential Adviser on Human Rights and by the Regional People's Advocate confirmed that a unit of the army's anti-kidnap force, UNASE, had been in the area at the time. Eye-witnesses have reported that the UNASE unit detained Luis Alirio Rodriguez. The major in charge of the unit has denied this and claims that he was released after questioning. On 28 July a petition of habeas corpus was placed in Barranquilla, the results of which are not yet known."
