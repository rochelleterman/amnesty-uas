"USA (Texas): Death penalty / Legal concern: Johnathan Bryant Moore (m) 
 NA 
 Johnathan Moore is scheduled to be executed on 17 January 2007 in Texas.  He was sentenced to death in November 1996 for the murder of a police officer in San Antonio in January 1995. At the trial, Johnathan Moore pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, a very difficult plea on which to prevail. The defence lawyers argued that, as a result of the defendant's mental illness, the symptoms of which had for some time included paranoid delusions that authority figures, particularly the police, were trying to kill him.
