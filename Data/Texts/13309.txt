 Singapore    Death penalty/imminent execution:  Natthapong Khwan-on (m), Thai national | Amnesty International 
 Thai National Natthapong Khwan-o, sentenced to death for the murder of a taxi driver is reportedly scheduled to be executed on 6 March 2002. It is unclear whether he has appealed against the conviction. The Thai embassy in Singapore is said to be preparing to petition the Singaporean President to commute the sentence. Natthapong Khwan-on was sentenced to death in December 2001 for the murder of an elderly taxi driver, who he also robbed of his mobile phone and wallet on 19 November 2001. The Singapore High Court rejected Natthapong Khwan-on's defence that he was mentally ill at the time of the offence.
