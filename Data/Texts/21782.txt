 Bahrain: Further information: Hunger striking activist's health failing: Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The health of Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja , one of the 14 imprisoned activists in Bahrain, has deteriorated as he passes his 64th day on hunger strike. The authorities refused to release him and the other 13 opposition activists waiting for a hearing before the Court of Cassation on 23 April. Amnesty International is concerned that Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja might die in detention."
