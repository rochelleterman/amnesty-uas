 Peru: Fear of torture or ill-treatment /Legal concern   Political prisoners in high security prisons | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that the Peruvian authorities may use excessive force to quell hunger strikes by more than 600 political prisoners, the majority from Castro Castro Prison in Lima, Peru. The authorities have used cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment to suppress uprisings in the past where prisoners have been killed in the process.
