 Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who is facing death by stoning, her son Sajjad Qaderzadeh, her lawyer Javid Houtan Kiyan and two German journalists, who are all currently detained in Iran, reportedly made self-incriminating statements on state TV on 15 November 2010. Such statements, likely to have been made under duress, should not be accepted as evidence in court."
