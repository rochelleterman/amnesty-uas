 Chakufwa Chihana, Secretary General of the Southern Africa Trade Union Coordination Council, was sentenced on 14 December 1992 to two years' imprisonment for sedition. He had been on bail before and during his trial but has now been reimprisoned, apparently in Zomba Prison. He was convicted for possession of papers he gave to a conference in Zambia on the prospects for multi-party democracy in Malawi and for illegally importing them into Malawi. AI believes him to be a prisoner of conscience and is calling for his immediate release. Chafukwa Chihana was imprisoned without charge in the 1970s because of his political differences with the ruling Malawi Congress Party. "
