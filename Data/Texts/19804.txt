 NA 
 José Luí­s da Silva, his wife Severina dos Santos Silva and their 25-year-old daughter Edisandra, have received death threats in relation to a court case brought against four men they allege were involved in a violent attack on their family in December 2007. The family believe that they were targeted specifically because of their fight for land rights, which has involved a long-running dispute with a local farm owner. They may face further attacks and intimidation before the next court hearing, which is scheduled for 10 February 2009."
