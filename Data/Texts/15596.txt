 Russian Federation: Torture and ill-treatment/Fear of torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of three 16-year old boys from Nizhnii Novgorod. Andrei Osenchugov, Aleksei Shishkin and Leonid Volkov have reportedly been subjected to torture and ill-treatment in a pre-trial detention centre in order to force them to confess to a crime, which they claim they have not committed. They are at risk of further torture and ill-treatment as a consequence of their complaint.
