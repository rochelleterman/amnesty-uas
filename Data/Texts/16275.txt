 Uzbekistan: Further information on Arbitrary detention/fear for safety/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Rahima Akhmadalieva was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment on 21 September, for ""undermining the constitutional order of Uzbekistan"". Amnesty International is concerned at reports that charges against Rahima Akhmadalieva were fabricated and that she has been imprisoned solely to punish her for not disclosing the whereabouts of her husband, independent imam (religious leader) Ruhiddin Faruddinov, who is wanted on allegedly fabricated charges of ""Wahhabism"".
