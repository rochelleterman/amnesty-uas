 Algeria:  Arrests / prosecution / police intimidation /  fear for safety / fear of further detentions  of the relatives of the ""disappeared"" | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is very concerned that a peaceful   demonstration of mothers, wives, sisters, daughters and   other relatives of the ""disappeared"", which is held       weekly in Oran, Western Algeria, was violently broken up  by police on 22 March 2000 with the arrests of at least   15 women. All the women had been released by the next     morning except for Fatima 'Ime who is still detained at   the central police station in Oran. Fatima Ben Mousa,     Rahmouna Bourahla, Faouzia Guene and Badra  Leban, were   detained until the morning of 23 March, made to sign      police statements, and told to report back to the police  station in Oran on 25 March. It is     expected that they and Fatima 'Ime will be charged with   participating in   an unauthorized demonstration.
