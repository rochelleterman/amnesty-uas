 Saudi Arabia: Medical Concern/Possible prisoner of conscience: Dr Sa'id Bin Zu'air (m) 

 | Amnesty International 
 University Professor Dr Sa'id Bin Zu'air, aged about 55, university professor, has been in jail since April 2004 for criticising the government. His health is reportedly failing, and the prison authorities may be denying him access to adequate medical treatment. Amnesty International believes he may be a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for the legitimate exercise of his right to freedom of expression.
