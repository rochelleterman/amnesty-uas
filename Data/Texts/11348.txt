 UA 330/92 - India: illegal detention / fear of torture / fear of extrajudicial execution / harassment: Harjit Singh and his family | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Reports indicate that Harjit Singh, son of Kashmir Singh of village Buttar Kalan, is still being illegally held by the security forces in Punjab, although the authorities deny holding him. He was arrested on 29 April 1992 and allegedly tortured after arrest. On 12 May the police issued a statement claiming that he had been killed during an armed encounter with terrorists. However, a relative accompanying a warrant officer who was trying to establish Harjit Singh's whereabouts reportedly saw him in an interrogation centre in Amritsar on 17 October 1992. When the warrant officer was finally allowed into the interrogation centre, all the rooms were found to be empty. Harjit Singh's family have reportedly fled their home in fear of police harassment.
