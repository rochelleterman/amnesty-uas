 An estimated 90 million migrants live and work outside their country of birth, many of them having left in search of security and a sustainable livelihood. Many economies have come to rely on migrants who are prepared  to work in what are often referred to as ""3-D jobs"" - dirty, degrading and dangerous with little security and   low wages."
