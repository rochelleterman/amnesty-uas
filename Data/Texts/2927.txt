 Sudan: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Human rights defender Dr Mudawi Ibrahim was arrested on 8 May by members of the National Security and Intelligence Agency, in Khartoum North. Yasir Salim and Abdallah Taha were arrested with him: both work for the organisation headed by Dr Mudawi, the Sudan Development Organisation (SUDO). The three are said to be held in the National Security Centre, Khartoum North. No reason has been given for their arrest. Amnesty International considers all three to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for their peaceful activities in defence of human rights.
