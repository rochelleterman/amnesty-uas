 United Kingdom: Further information on impunity / legal concern: Augusto Pinochet | Amnesty International 
 The House of Lords ruled  on 25 November 1998, by a majority of three to two that Augusto Pinochet is not immune from prosecution as a former head of state. Amnesty International has written to UK Home Secretary Jack Straw, with whom the decision to extradite now rests, to say that such a decision should only be decided by a court.
