 NA 
 AI has learned that Hafedh Ben Gharbia held in illegally prolonged incommunicado detention until 18 May 1995. He was then tried in Tunis on 27 May and sentenced to 14 months' imprisonment for participating in a meeting and demonstration in Germany in 1988. He was sentenced on the basis of legislation introduced in November 1993, which makes it possible to imprison Tunisian nationals for peacful activities abroad which are considered offences in Tunisia. AI considers him to be a prisoner of conscience and is calling for his immediate and unconditional release."
