 Idham Kurniawan, Anton Sulton, Hamad Haviz Azdam and Usep Setiawan have not been seen since 14 August 2000.  They   were reportedly apprehended by members of the Police      Mobile Brigade (BRIMOB) outside the parliament. Amnesty   International is concerned for their safety, fearing that they may have    ""disappeared"" and may be at risk of      torture or            extrajudicial execution.
