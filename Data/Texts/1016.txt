 Guinea Bissau: Fear for safety/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Four jounalists, Allen Y‰ro Embalo, Alberto Dabo, Eva     Maria Auzenda Biague and Fernando Jorge Perreira, have    gone   into hiding after threats from the military after  they    reported on the way Guinea-Bissau is being used   as a      transit point by drug-smugglers. If detained by the       military, they would be at risk of torture.     Human rights  defender Mario Sa Gomes, who publicly       called for civilian and military officials involved in    the drug trade to be   dismissed, has gone into hiding in fear for his life.
