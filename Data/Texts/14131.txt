 Spain: Abduction / torture / fear for safety: Protected witness ""1964/S"" and other witnesses involved in official investigation into past human rights violations | Amnesty International 
 A protected witness in the investigation into the kidnapping, torture and murder in 1983 of two members of the armed Basque group, Basque Homeland and Liberty (ETA), by members of the Spanish security forces, was kidnapped, handcuffed and beaten a week after he had given evidence to the judge implicating members of the Civil Guard in the crimes. Amnesty International is concerned for his safety and the safety of others involved in the ongoing investigations into human rights violations carried out in the 1980s.
