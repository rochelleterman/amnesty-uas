 There are fears for the safety of 36 residents of the town of Eshowe, Geinsila township, and surrounding areas, Natal province, whose names appear on a ""hit list"", copies of which were found in the area on 30 March 1994. Those named include ANC officials, ANC members and others. There have been several incidents in the area including that of the night of 1 April when three people were shot dead in the home of the Mkize family, Zamokwakhe Mikize's two younger brothers, Wiseman and Linda, and a male visitor, Linda Mazibuko. Linda Mkize had recently been threatened by Chief B I Zulu, who has been implicated in several violent incidents, during which members of the Kwazulu Police force were present."
