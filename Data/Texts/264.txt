 Burundi: Further information on  Fear of ill-treatment/prisoners of       conscience | Amnesty International 
 Jean Nzigirabarya was released without charge on the      morning of 23 November, but was rearrested in the         afternoon shortly after the arrest of Cyprien             Sindayigaya. Cyprien Sindayigaya was arrested apparently  because he was suspected of helping Jean Nzigirabarya     pass information on human rights violations perpetrated   by the armed forces to the National Assembly, where he    works as a security guard.
