 UA 382/93 - Sudan: fear of torture: Baha'a al-Din Abul Gassim | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Baha'a al-Din Abul Gassim was arrested on 25 October 1993 by four armed plainclothes security officers from outside his family home in south Khartoum. His whereabouts are unknown, and there is grave concern for his safety. The reasons for his arrest are unknown, but he is the brother of Major Issam Abul Gassim, an army officer executed with 27 others on 24 April 1990, after being convicted of an attempted coup at an unfair military trial. The families of the executed army officers have since been regularly harrassed and arrested by the security authorities. "
