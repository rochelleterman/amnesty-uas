 Rwanda/Tanzania: Fear of refoulement: more than 500,000 Rwandese refugees in Tanzania | Amnesty International 
 The Tanzanian Government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have issued a joint statement in which the Government of Tanzania states that all Rwandese refugees can now return to their country in safety and that they are expected to return home by 31 December 1996.
