 Indonesia: Fear of ill-treatment: 269 Vietnamese asylum-seekers | Amnesty International 
 AI fears that 269 Vietnamese asylum-seekers, detained by the Indonesian authorities in the state prison in Tanjung Pinang, on the island of Bintan, are at risk of ill-treatment. The 269 people had their asylum claims rejected and are due to be repatriated to Viet Nam within the next two months. This group has been isolated from the main group of more than 4,000 Vietnamese because they have actively opposed the repatriation process.
