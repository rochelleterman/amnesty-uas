 Unofficial sources in Lhasa have reported that Sonam Wangdu and Lhundrup Gaden have been released. The terms of their release are not known and it is thought that they still face unspecified restrictions. Both have apparently suffered severe paralysis and ill-health as a result of torture and ill-treatment."
