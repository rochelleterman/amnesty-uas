 UA 254/93 - Uzbekistan: legal concern: Pulat Akhunov | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Pulat Akhunov, a probable prisoner of conscience, is on trial again in the city of Andizhan, charged with illegal possession of narcotics and assaulting a prison guard. If convicted he faces a maximum additional sentence of 10 years' imprisonment. He is currently serving 18 months after being convicted of an allegedly fabricated criminal charge of petty hooliganism. There is concern at reports that these new charges are also fabricated, and that he is not receiving a fair trial because his lawyer has been prevented from calling important defence witnesses. Pulat Akhunov is a deputy chairman of the opposition Birlik (""Unity"") movement. "
