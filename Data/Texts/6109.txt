 UA 52/93 - Guatemala: fear for safety / attempted extrajudicial execution: Carlos Gomez | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Armed and masked men reportedly tried to kill Carlos Gomez, deputy secretary of the Union de Trabajadores de Quetzaltenango (UTQ), as he travelled by bus to Quetzaltenango from Guatemala City on the night of 25 February 1993. The men reportedly took his video camera and audio-visual materials relating to a recent visit he had made to the Comunidades de Poblacion en Resistencia and the settlements in Ixcan for recently returned refugees. He had been investigating living conditions in the places he had visited. Carlos Gomez has had two operations since the attack and is reportedly in poor health. "
