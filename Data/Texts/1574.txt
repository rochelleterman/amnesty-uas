"Nigeria: Fear of ill-treatment / possible prisoner of conscience: Chief Olu Falae 
 NA 
 Chief Olu Falae, aged 59, former Secretary to the Federal Government and Minister of Finance, leading member of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) and former prisoner of conscience, was arrested at his home in Akure on 9 January 1997. He has not been charged but has apparently been detained in connection with recent bomb attacks in Lagos. There is concern that he may be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely on account of his non-violent political views, and fears that he may be held in harsh conditions.
