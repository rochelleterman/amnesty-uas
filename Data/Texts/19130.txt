 Salaheddine Zikikout, arrested on 8 August 1993, will be tried on 11 October at the Tunis Court of First Instance, after being held for 53 days in unlawful incommunicado detention. He was brought before the prosecutor on 19 September, but was denied access to his lawyer until 29 September. He was reportedly tortured whilst held incommunicado and also reportedly signed a police statement under duress without knowing its contents."
