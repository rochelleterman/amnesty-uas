 Amnesty International is concerned for the health of Feliciano Pineda and Marcelino Miranda, indigenous community leaders, held at the prison in Gracias, Lempira Department, Honduras. Feliciano Pineda was attacked and seriously injured on 5 June 2005, by four men with machetes, reportedly linked to a powerful local landowning family. Marcelino Miranda reportedly is suffering from Chagas' disease. Amnesty International calls for immediate access to medical care for both men and for their release, unless clear and substantive evidence can be produced against them."
