 Tunisia: Further information on health concern for hunger strike prisoners | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Several of the Tunisian prisoners on hunger strike have   ended their protest, but many are suffering severe health problems as a result of not  eating for so long. Neither  the prisoners who are still on hunger strike, nor those   who have ended their hunger strikes are getting the       medical care that they need."
