 A colleague of Donny Reyes, transvestite activist and sex worker Josef Fabio Estrada (also known as Debora) was attacked by a group of five men on 20 April. Police officers nearby reportedly encouraged the men to carry on beating him, and arrested him when he wounded one of his attackers. He has since been charged with attempted murder. He is reportedly being held in unsafe conditions in the state penitentiary and has received no medical attention.
