 Amnesty International has now learned that the nine people named above (not twelve as was previously thought) were executed on 1 March 1993 at Luzira Upper Prison near Kampala. Concern remains for the others who remain under sentence of death, whose appeals have been rejected by the Supreme Court and are also at risk of execution. "
