 The planned forced evictions in the Arco Iris neighbourhood of Lubango, Angola, which were scheduled for 25 August, did not take place. Residents believe the work of Amnesty International and the local NGO Association Building Communities (Associação Construindo Comunidades - ACC) contributed to stopping the forced eviction."
