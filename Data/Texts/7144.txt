 Peter Blaine and Dalton Daley were due to be hanged today and Milton Montique was due to be hanged on 1 December 1998 (dates amended from original action).  Yesterday, all were granted stays of execution pending the hearing of constitutional motions filed by each man after the execution warrants were issued.  These motions include a claim that it would be unconstitutional to execute them whilst they have petitions pending before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).
