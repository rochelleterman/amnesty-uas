 Those named above are reported to be among hundres of suspected Sunni Islamist opponents of the government arrested between 13 and 19 September 1994. The vast majority include religious scholars, businessmen, students and academics. They are being held incommunicado in al-Hair prison, General Intelligence headquarters in al-'Ulaisha and in police stations in al-Quseem and Riyadh. There is grave concern they may be subjected to torture and ill-treatment."
