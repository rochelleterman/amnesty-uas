 UA 136/94 - Turkey: ""disappearance"": Necati Aydin, Mehmet Ay | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Necati Aydin, President of ""Tum Saglik-Sen"" (Health Workers Trade Union), and Mehmet Ay, who ""disappeared"" in Diyarbakir following their detention by police on 18 March 1994. They were detained at the home of Mehmet Ay's elder brother, together with eight other relatives who were released four days later. On 25 March the prosecutor at the State Security Court in Diyarbakir confirmed that they were still in custody. However on 4 April lawyers informed Mehmet Ay's elder brother that they had seen the two men in court. When he then approached the chief prosecutor, he was informed that they had been released. However they were neither seen by those waiting for them outside the court, nor have their relatives been able to obtain information as to their whereabouts."
