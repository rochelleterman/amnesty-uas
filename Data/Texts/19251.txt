 Tunisia: Prisoner of conscience: Salah Zeghidi | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is gravely concerned at the arrest on 7 October 1996 of Salah Zeghidi, Vice-President of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH). He was arrested on his return from Paris, where he had participated in a public meeting on the human rights situation in Tunisia. AI believes that he was arrested solely because of his human rights activities, and considers him to be a prisoner of conscience.
