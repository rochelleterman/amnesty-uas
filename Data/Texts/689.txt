 NA 
 Pedro Motu Mamiaga died in the Malabo security police headquarters following his arrest on 22 August 1993. He was reported to have been severely tortured. On 23 August the authorities announced that he had committed suicide in prison, but gave no further details. Another detainee, Miguel Nse Bacale, an army serjeant, is also reported to have been very badly tortured, and is said to be in a coma as a result. He is apparently still held in the security police headquarters. The two men were among dozens of people arrested in Malabo, the capital on Bioko Island, at the end of August. "
