 Ko Mya Aye, a pro-democracy activist imprisoned in Myanmar, is in urgent need of medical treatment for a heart condition. The authorities have so far failed to provide the treatment he requires. He is being held in Taungyi prison, Shan state, in northern Myanmar, far from emergency medical treatment facilities, and hundreds of kilometres from his family."
