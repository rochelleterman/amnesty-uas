 | Amnesty International 
 A hearing on prisoner of conscience Camilo Mej’a's application for conscientious objector status was held on 23 June, at Fort Sill military prison, Oklahoma, where he is imprisoned for his conscientious objection to participating in war. A decision on this is expected in the next few weeks. An appeal against his court martial conviction on charges of desertion is also pending. Further appeals on this case are crucial now to ensure that the military authorities act now to secure Camilo Mej’a's immediate and unconditional release.
