 The eight persons named above were arrested at Kinshasa's Ndjili airport on 13 December 1992 as they were preparing to welcome a delegation of French- based human rights activists. The Special Presidential Guard Division reportedly assaulted them before taking them to the headquarters of the Civil Guard. The eight, who include advisors and officials working with the Prime Minister and a journalist, do not appear to have been charged. There is concern about their physical safety. The head of a human rights group in Zaire, Guillaume Ngefa, was also arrested and beaten but released shortly afterwards. "
