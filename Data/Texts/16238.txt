 UA 89/94 - Uzbekistan: fear of imminent execution: Abdurakhmon (Rakhmon) Akhatov, Abdukhamid Khakimov, Alisher Obidov | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The above named men face imminent execution after being sentenced to death by the Supreme Court in Tashkent on 27 January 1994. They have no right of appeal, but may petition the President for clemency. However, this may not automatically mean that their sentence is suspended while such a petition is under consideration. There is concern that the defendants in the case were severely beaten in pre-trial detention in order to try and extract confessions from them. There is also concern that police may have exploited Abdikhamid Khakimov's mental illness into making a confession and making accusations against others."
