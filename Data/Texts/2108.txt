 EXTRA 10/93 - South Africa (Bophuthatswana): death penalty: Zacharia Machaisa | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A warrant of execution has reportedly been prepared for Zacharia Machaisa, who has been under sentence of death since 1987 for a murder committed when he was 19 years old. As of 4 February he had not been informed of the date scheduled for his execution. Zacharia Machaisa submitted a petition for clemency in January 1991 in which he claimed to have acted out of fear of an older person and expressed remorse for his part in the murder. Supplementary evidence about his childhood and his epilepsy was submitted in support of the petition, which was refused. AI fears that his execution may be imminent. "
