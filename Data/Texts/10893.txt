 People's Republic of China: arbitrary arrest / fear for safety: Hongda Harry Wu | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned for the safety of Hongda Harry Wu, a naturalized citizen of the USA and former political prisoner in China. He was detained in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on 19 June 1995. His place of detention since 23 June is unknown; he has reportedly been denied access to a representative of the US Embassy. AI believes his detention may be related to his involvement in publicizing information about political imprisonment and human rights abuses in China. AI considers him to be a prisoner of conscience who should be released immediately and unconditionally."
