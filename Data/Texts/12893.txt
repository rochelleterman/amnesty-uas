 Pakistan: Arbitrary arrest/possible ""disappearance""/fear of torture: Munir Mengal (m) | Amnesty International 
 Munir Mengal, TV station director, who reportedly has no links to any political party, was arrested by intelligence agents on 4 April at Karachi airport. He has been preparing to launch a Baloch-language TV station, and this appears to be at least part of the reason he was arrested. His whereabouts are unknown, and he is in danger of torture or ""disappearance"".
