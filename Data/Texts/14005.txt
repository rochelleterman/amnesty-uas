 Cousins Tom Natsis, aged 23, and Roberto Natsis, aged 25, were detained by Greek police on 4 March 1993 in Zagora, central eastern Greece. They have not been seen since, and police have issued confused statements about their detention. The two men are ethnic Greeks with Albanian citizenship, and prior to their ""disappearance"" they were working on tourist visas. "
