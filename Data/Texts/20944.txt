 Haji Memet and Abdusalam Nasir were detained on 23 September, in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in northwest China, reportedly on suspicion of leaking “state secrets”. The “state secrets” are believed to be related to allegations of torture that led to the death of Shoret Tursun, Haji Memet’s relative. Both men are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. "
