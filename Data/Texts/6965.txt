 McArthur Fils-Aime, a member of the Raboteau Resistance Movement, was arrested and beaten on 29 August 1994 by two uniformed soldiers. He had previously been arrested in June 1994, reportedly accused of listening to the Voice of America programme on the radio, and was only released after paying a fine. He is currently held at the barracks in Grande Saline, and there is concern for his safety."
