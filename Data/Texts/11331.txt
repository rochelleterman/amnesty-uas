 Malwinder Singh Malli, a journalist for the Punjabi Tribune and former General Secretary of the Punjab Human Rights Association, was reportedly arrested on 23 August 1992. He is believed to be held in the Sangrur District under the National Security Act. He is a close associate of another Sikh journalist, Ram Singh Billing, whose whereabouts are unknown since he was reported to have been arrested on 3 January 1992. Both had been involved in bringing legal action on behalf of two young Sikh detainees and had filed a petition on their behalf in the Punjab and Haryana High Court in Chandigarh. "
