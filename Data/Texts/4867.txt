 Colombia: Fear for safety/possible ""disappearance"" | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the safety of indigenous and peasant farmer communities in Tame Municipality, department of Arauca, after over 800 community members were forcibly displaced in recent weeks. Two indigenous people, including a pregnant 16-year-old, have been killed and three indigenous men are thought to have ""disappeared"" in a wave of human rights violations committed by paramilitaries operating in collusion with the armed forces.
