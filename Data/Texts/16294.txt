 UA 263/94 - Uzbekistan: ""disappearance"": Murad Dzhurayev, Erkin Ashurov | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Murad Dzhurayev and Erkin Ashurov, activists of the outlawed Erk (Freedom) party, have ""disappeared"". Unofficial sources have alleged that they were abducted on the night of 17-18 June 1994 from Almaty, Kazakhstan, where they were living as political exiles. Their abductors are believed to have been officers of Uzbekistan's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Sources have suggested that they may have been arrested in connection with a continuing clampdown against a clandestine newspaper which Erk produces."
