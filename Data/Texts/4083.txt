 Chile: Fear of total impunity / legal concern | Amnesty International 
 On 17 September 1997, the Military Prosecutor General presented a new petition to the Supreme Court of Justice to instruct all appeal courts and judges to proceed with the definite closure of the legal proceedings into hundreds of cases of human rights violations from the initial period of military government. The petition covers all cases of ""disappearances"" and extrajudicial executions between September 1973 and March 1978. If the petition is approved it will lead to complete impunity for perpetrators of past human rights violations.
