 Eight student activists have been detained during a series of arrests which began in July 2008. According to the Vancouver-based Association for the Defence of Azerbaijani Political Prisoners (ADAPP), their families have been denied access to them, though some have had irregular contact by telephone. None have had access to legal representation of their choice and Amnesty International fears that they may be prisoners of conscience, arrested solely for the expression of their conscientiously held beliefs."
