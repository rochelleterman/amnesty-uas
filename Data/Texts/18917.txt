 UA 303/93 - Algeria: fear of expulsion: Ameur Legraidi, Fathi Ouerghi (Tunisian nationals) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ameur Legraidi and Fathi Ouerghi, Tunisian nationals seeking asylum in Algeria, are at risk of expulsion to Tunisia and have been held incommunicado since their arrest on 13 June 1993. If returned to Tunisia, they would be at risk of torture and ill-treatment in pre-trial detention. They left Tunisia in 1992 fearing persecution because of their membership of the unauthorized Islamist movement, Al-Nahda. In August 1992 Ameur Legraidi was condemned in absentia to 11 years' imprisonment in an unfair trial. The two were both registered as refugees by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Algiers in October 1992, and were given leave to stay by the Algerian Foreign Affairs Ministry.
