 On the night of 23 February 2008 the Nepal Police reportedly arrested Tsering Dhondup, a Tibetan refugee, at the Tibetan Reception Centre in Kathmandu, Nepal. His current whereabouts remains unknown. Amnesty International fears that he may have been deported to China, in which case he would be at grave risk of torture or other ill-treatment."
