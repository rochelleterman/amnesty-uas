 UA 33/93 - Sudan: fear of torture / legal concern: Mohamed Abdulsid (includes correction) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Mohamed Abdulsid, Khartoum correspondent of the newspaper Asharq al-Awsat, was arrested on 28 January 1993 and is believed to be held incommunicado either at the security headquarters in Khartoum or at a secret detention centre (or ""ghost house""). Asharq al-Awsat has consistently carried stories quoting political leaders opposed to the government; its offices in Khartoum have been closed. Mohamed Abdulsid recently interviewed former prime minister Sadiq al-Mahdi; this was reported in the newspaper. AI has adopted Mohamed Abdulsid as a prisoner of conscience. "
