 According to a number of unofficial reports, Damchoe Pemo, who was arrested in Lhasa on 20 May 1993, miscarried a week later after police forced her to remain standing for at least 12 hours and beat her with electric batons. She was said to have been in a critical condition in early June. A Lhasa trader in her mid-twenties, she was reportedly four or five months pregnant when she was detained. Although a nurse has apparently been allowed to visit her in prison , it is not thought that she was transferred to hospital at any stage. She was detained on suspicion of belonging to a pro- independence organization, following the arrest of her uncle, Lobsang Gyaltsen on 15 May and her husband, Tashi Topgyal. At least 107 Tibetans were reportedly arrested between April and July. "
