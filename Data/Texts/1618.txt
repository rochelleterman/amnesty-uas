 The three human rights activists named above were charged on 12 July 1993 before a magistrate's court in the federal capital, Abuja, with sedition and conspiracy under the Penal Code (Northern Region). The charges carry a maxiumum penalty of seven years' imprisonment. On 15 July they were remanded in prison until 30 September. They are believed to have been initially held under legislation which permits administrative detention for renewable periods of six weeks. They are reportedly being held incommunicado, and have been denied medical attention. Alhaji Lamidi Adedibu, a prominent member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), was arrested on 20 July in Ibadan, Oyo State, after calling for a boycott of new presidential elections. He is not known to have been charged with any offence. "
