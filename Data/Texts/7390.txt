 Prisoner of conscience Manuel Manriquez San Augustin gave up his hunger strike at the end of August 1994. His last appeal against his prison sentence was rejected on 31 August 1994. On 11 November, he was transferred to the Santa Martha Acatitla Prison in Mexico city, which is reported to be overcrowded and to have deficient sanitation. However, he is believed to be well despite his current conditions of detention and the effects of his prolonged hunger strike. He remains active in campaigning against human rights violations in Mexico. AI continues to call for his release."
