 Despite evidence from people arrested with him, Naval     authorities still deny having Vyramuttu Jeyakili in       custody. Plainclothes naval officers have reportedly      threatened his relatives, and the two people arrested     with him, to say nothing about him and file no court      action on his behalf. Fears for his life are mounting.
