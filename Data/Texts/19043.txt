 UA 66/94 - Tunisia: fear of torture in illegally prolonged incommunicado detention: Ali Mabouj | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Ali Mabouj is being held in illegally prolonged garde a vue detention after his arrest on 6 February 1994. A shop-keeper in France, he had only returned to Tunisia on 1 February in order to take his wife and children with him back to France. He has reportedly never been involved in any political activities, and may have been arrested in connection with the recent imprisonment of a nephew. One of Ali Mamouj's brothers was recently arrested twice and detained for a few days. He was only released once Ali Mabouj had been arrested."
