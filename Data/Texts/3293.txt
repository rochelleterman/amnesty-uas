 According to reports six people were seriously wounded when troops of President Mobutu's elite Special Presidential Division (MSP) opened fire on a crowd outside the house of Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi in Kinshasa on 15 April 1993. The DSP arrived as a cabinet meeting was being held there in defiance of President Mobutu's self-nominated government, and are reported to have fired on the crowd without provocation. The six are believed to have been members of Tshisekedi's political party, the Union pour la democratie et le Progres social (UDPS). "
