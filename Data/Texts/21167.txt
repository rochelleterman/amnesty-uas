 Following an Urgent Action issued by Amnesty International on 11 May, additional security has been ordered for regional parliamentarians Saleem Khursheed Khokhar and Pitamber Sewani. They had been receiving threats for campaigning against forced conversions and marriages from the Hindu minority community in Sindh province, Pakistan. Hindu communities in Sindh continue to face persecution and attacks. Pakistani authorities must ensure perpetrators of these attacks are brought to justice."
