 Arrests of members of the Sidama Liberation Movement (SLA) are continuing amid allegations that some detainees have been ill-treated in custody. Getu Tenite and Daniso Borsama have been detained without charge or trial since 16 August 1994. Acting Vice-Chairman of the SLM, Lemma Sidamo, was arrested on 22 September 1994. His family have reportedly been unable to find out his place of detention and he has not been taken to court within the prescribed 48-hour limit."
