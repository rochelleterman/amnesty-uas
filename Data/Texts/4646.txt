 UA 108/94 - Colombia: fear for safety: Dr Rafael Barrios Mendivil | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is serious concern for the safety of Dr Rafael Barrios Mendivil who has decided to return to Colombia to continue his work as a human rights lawyer. He left the country in October 1993 after receiving death threats. He is President of the human rights lawyers' association, Corporacion Colectivo de Abogados Jose Alvear Restrepo. Concerns for his safety are heightened by the virtual impunity with which members of the Colombian security forces continue to commit human rights abuses."
