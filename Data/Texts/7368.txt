 Marcelino Santiago Pacheco, who is from the Loxicha region of Oaxaca State, has not been seen since leaving his residence in Oaxaca City at 8.30 pm, on 27 April. There are concerns for his safety as he was reportedly detained and tortured by the security forces in 1997, before being imprisoned for five years. He was also expected to provide evidence to a potential enquiry into human rights violations against members of the indigenous Zapotec community.
