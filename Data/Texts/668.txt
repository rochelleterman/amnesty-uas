 Equatorial Guinea: fear of imminent execution: Pedro Masa Mba (soldier), Lieutenant-Colonel Pedro Esono Masie (retired) | Amnesty International

 AI is appealing on behalf of Pedro Masa Mba and Pedro Esono Masie, who were tried by a military court in Malabo on 19 April 1995. The prosecutor asked for the death penalty for the two men, who were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. The court is meeting today to pass sentence. AI believes the trial to have been unfair: the men have no right of appeal against their conviction or sentence. If sentenced to death, AI fears that the sentenced could be carried out at any time."
