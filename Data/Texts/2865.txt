 Sudan: Prisoners of conscience / fear of torture: Mustapha Abdel Gadir, lawyer, Mohamed Ali al-Sayid, lawyer, Bushra Abdel Karim, lawyer | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 12 September 1995 Mustapha Abdel Gadir and Mohamed Ali al-Said were arrested in Khartoum.  The men, both prominent lawyers, are reported to be detained without charge or trial by the security services in Kober prison. Bushra Abdel Karim, another lawyer, is believed to have been arrested at the same time.  All men are known critics of the government and have played a leading role in defending government opponents brought before the courts on criminal charges.  AI is concerned that they have been arrested because of their history of non-violent political activity and that they are at risk of torture."
