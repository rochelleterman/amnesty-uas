 Liberia: Fear of torture and ill-treatment/Prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned about the safety of the human rights community in Liberia,          following a series of arrests on 29 October. Human rights defenders have frequently been the target of arbitrary    arrest and detention and are routinely tortured and       ill-treated.
