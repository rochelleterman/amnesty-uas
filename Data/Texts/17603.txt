 Since 6 February 1995, at least 200 suspected members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) and the Islamist groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been arrested by the security forces of the Palestinian Authority (PA). They have been held in detention, without access to lawyers or a judge and, in many cases, to their families. Many appear to have been released but at least 51 people have been held in Gaza Central Prison without access to a lawyer or judge (including those listed above)."
