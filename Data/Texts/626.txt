 At least four peaceful demonstrators were killed and over 20 others injured by members of the Djibouti armed forces. They were shot during a demonstration by displaced people in Ariba to protest at the government-ordered destruction of temporary shelters. Up to 600 people were reportedly arrested and taken to Nagad prison but were relased the next day. A further six people (named above) have been held since 5 June in an army camp. AI is concerned for their safety. AI is also concerned that if the destruction of temporary shelters continues, displaced people protesting against this could be subjected to human rights violations."
