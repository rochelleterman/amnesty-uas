 Guatemala: Further information on death penalty: Proposed resumption of executions | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A bill that could lead to the resumption of executions in Guatemala re-entered Congress on 26 March 2008, and is now being considered by the Congressional Home Affairs Committee. The Committee has one month to make a recommendation on Decree 06-2008, as the bill is known, before it is voted on by Congress in full. If two thirds of the members of Congress vote in support of the bill, it will become law, meaning that there will be a danger that executions in Guatemala may resume."
