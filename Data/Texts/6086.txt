 There is concern for the safety of Juan Enrique Quinonez Schwank, who has reportedly been subjected to repeated death threats. He is Technical Director of the Association for the Development of Central America (ADEPAC), and a member of the Executive Committee of the Coordination of NGOs and Cooperatives for the Accompaniment of Victims of the Internal Armed Conflict. Both organizations are concerned with the issue of Guatemalan refugees. According to reports, since 25 December 1993, he has received seven telephone death threats and one written threat which was signed in the name of a group calling itself the Guatemalan Anticommunist League."
