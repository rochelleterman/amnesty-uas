 Ayatollah Ya'sub al-Din Rastgari was reportedly released from prison on 21 December 1996. Unconfirmed reports, however, suggest he is currently under house arrest in Qom. There is no information about his legal status, but it is feared he may be held under house arrest solely because of his expression of his conscientiously-held beliefs.
