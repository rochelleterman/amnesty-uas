 Afghanistan: Death penalty/ legal concern

 | Amnesty International 
 Afghanistan's Supreme Court has reportedly upheld the death sentences of Zar Jan, his brother Abdul Wahid and Reza Khan, who were found guilty of involvement in the 2001 murder of four journalists. Amnesty International is concerned that the three men may not have received a fair and independent trial in accordance with international standards.
