 Local journalist Carlos Solís Reina and Luis Alberto Salas Barajas were arrested by the Federal Preventive Police (Policía Federal Preventiva, PFP) on 15 September 2008 in Matamoros, Tamaulipas state, after the car in which they were travelling was shot at by members of the PFP. A 17-year-old girl walking nearby died as a result of the shooting. Amnesty International is concerned that the two men may be at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. "
