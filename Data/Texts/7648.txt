 Mexico: Fear for safety: Maria Eugenia Cazares (f) | Amnesty International 
 Maria Eugenia Cazares and her family are reported to have been subjected to a series of threats and other acts of intimidation by members of the judicial police in Durango, as a result of a complaint filed by Maria Eugenia Cazares concerning the rape of her 16-year-old daughter Yessica Yadira Diaz Cazares on 16 March 1997 by three men, whom she later identified to the police. As a result of her appalling treatment, Yessica Yadira Diaz Cazares committed suicide on 16 June 1997. Fears for their safety have been heightened by an apparent attempt on the life of Maria Eugenia in recent days.
