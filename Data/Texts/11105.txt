 There are serious fear for the safety of the civilian population in the eastern Indian state of Bihar following reports of rape, assault and extrajudicial execution by police officers from other states, stationed in Bihar on election duty. The state elections take place on 11 March 1995. A mother and daughter were reportedly gang-raped on 18 February and on 20 February, a woman was attacked as she left her house. A neighbour, Jaganath Ram, who came to her aid, was later shot dead."
