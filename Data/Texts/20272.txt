 NA 
 A male correspondent for newspaper Cambio de Michoacán, in Michoacán state, western Mexico, has been missing since 6 April 2010. A female reporter for the same newspaper has been missing since November. Both were abducted after reporting on local crime and corruption. It is feared that, like two journalists from Michoacán who went missing a few years ago, their whereabouts may never be known. "
