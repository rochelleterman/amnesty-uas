 UA 46/93 - Rwanda: ""disappearance"" / fear of extrajudicial execution: Alphonse Nkunzurwanda, Celestin Palimehutu, Emmanuel Hakizimana | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The three people named above, students of the Universite adventiste de Mudende near Gisenyi in northern Rwanda, were arrested on 13 February 1993 and have not been seen since. Fellow-students and human rights workers fear that they may have been extrajudicially executed. Persecution of people suspected of supporting the rebel FPR has intensified since the beginning of January 1993. People from the minority Tutsi group and members of parties opposed to President Habyarimana's MRND party have been targeted by extremist Hutu vigilantes and the security forces. "
