 Algeria: Death penalty / legal concern: Lembarek Boumaarafi | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Lembarek Boumaarafi, accused of having killed Algerian President Boudiaf in 1992, was sentenced to death by the Algiers Criminal Court on 3 June 1995. There is concern that his trial was unfair. Lembarek Boumaarafi does not have full right of appeal, but may seek a review by cassation by Supreme Court. Cassation rules on procedures only and does not reexamine facts, thus failing to safeguard the accused's right of appeal. AI opposes the death penalty unconditionally and is calling for the sentence to be commuted."
