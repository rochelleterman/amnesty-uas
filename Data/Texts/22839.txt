 Syria: Mother and children held incommunicado | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A Syrian family, including two young children and a pregnant woman, have been held incommunicado since 15 May at the Air Force Intelligence branch in al-Mezzeh, Damascus. They appear to be prisoners of conscience, held in an attempt to place pressure on a wanted family member. They may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment."
