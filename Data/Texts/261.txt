 Following the reported execution of 13 men on 14 September 1994 by members of the security forces in Bujumbura, there is grave concern for the safety of those named above who have reportedly ""disappeared"" after being arrested between 9-16 September. The arrests appear to have occurred inthe context of the ongoing struggle between the security forces and armed opposition groups."
