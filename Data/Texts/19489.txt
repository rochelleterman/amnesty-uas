 NA 
 Former National Intelligence Agency officer Yahya Bajinka has been detained in secret since the 15 April 2007. He is now known to have been tortured, and is being denied medical attention in an attempt to keep his detention secret. His health has deteriorated so badly that without treatment he is likely to die."
