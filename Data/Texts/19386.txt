 Yemen: Further Information on fear for                    safety/incommunicado detention/medical concern: Ibrahim al-Saiani | Amnesty International 
 The health of 14-year-old Ibrahim al-Saiani is reported to have deteriorated in custody: he has begun to lose his memory, his hands tremble and he is unable to speak clearly. Ibrahim al-Saiani's family were first allowed to visit him in prison in August, and are now allowed weekly visits. However he remains detained without charge or trial and without access to legal counsel.
