 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of      three foreign-based Chinese dissidents. Wang Bingzhang,   Yue Wu and Zhang Qi reportedly went missing around 26     June on Vietnam's northern border with China, and their   whereabouts are unknown. Fears for the safety of exiled   Chinese dissident Yang Jianli have also increased         following reports that he has been held incommunicado for more than three months in China.
