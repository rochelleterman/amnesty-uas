 There is concern for the safety of Victor Manuel Alex and other street children following the deliberate fatal shooting of street child Sergio Miguel Chavez by a member of the municipal police on 7 September 1994. Following the shooting, which occurred in a large market in zone 1 of Guatemala City, Victor Alex was briefly detained by the police, and threatened that the same thing would happen to him if he related what happened."
