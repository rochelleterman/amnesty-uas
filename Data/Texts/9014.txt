 Bobby Shaw is scheduled to be executed on 9 June 1993. He had been granted a stay of execution to allow for an evaluation of his mental condition in a hearing held in March 1993. On 13 April, the judge ruled that he had sufficient understanding to meet the test of competency to be executed under state law, a finding which was disputed by a number of mental health experts who testified at the hearing. Bobby Shaw, 43, who is black, was sentenced to death in November 1980 for the murder of a white prison officer in July 1979. "
