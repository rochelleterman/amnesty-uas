 UA 347/93 - Cuba: prisoner of conscience / enforced exile / health concern: Sebastian Arcos Bergnes | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Sebastian Arcos Bergnes, Vice-President of the unofficial Comite Cubano Pro Derechos Humanos (CCPDH), Cuban Committee for Human Rights, was sentenced in October 1992 to four years' imprisonment for ""enemy propaganda"". He is a prisoner of conscience. In recent months he is said to have been put under pressure to accept exile abroad in exchange for his liberty, an offer which he has reportedly rejected. This pressure has reportedly comprised threats to cancel family visits, to prolong his sentence and to take reprisals against members of his family. He is reported to be in poor health. "
