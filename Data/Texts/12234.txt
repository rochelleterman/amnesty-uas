 Malaysia: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/fear of incommunicado detention | Amnesty International 
 The five men named above were arrested on 16 October by   the Malaysian police under the Internal Security Act      (ISA). It is not known where they are being held, or      whether they have access to legal representation or their families. Amnesty International is concerned that the     five are at risk of torture or ill-treatment during       police interrogation.
