 India: Fear for safety, Population of Ahmedabad, Gujarat. | Amnesty International 
 At least 242 people have been killed in the city of Ahmedabad since communal violence and rioting broke out on 28 February. Police have reportedly obstructed the work of NGOs and other organisations willing to take in relief supplies. Amnesty International is concerned that without these essential supplies, and the presence of neutral organisations to calm the situation, more people may die.
