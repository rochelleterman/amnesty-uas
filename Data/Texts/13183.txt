 Philippines: Imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Jurry Andal, Ricardo Andal and Edwin Mendoza are          scheduled for execution by lethal injection on 16,17 and  18 June 1999. Amnesty International is concerned that     Olympio Corrales, a witness who played a pivotal role in  the prosecution's case against the three men, was         tortured during interrogation, and that the defendants'   right to a fair trial may have been violated. The         organisation is further concerned that these allegations  of torture have not been fully and impartially            investigated.
