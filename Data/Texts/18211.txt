Khaidar Ghanem was arrested in the Gaza Strip on 3 July   by the Palestinian Preventative Security forces. He is    being held in incommunicado detention in Tel al-Hawa      prison in Gaza. He is at risk of torture or               ill-treatment. There are also concerns that he may not    receive a fair trial if he is charged and brought to      court.
