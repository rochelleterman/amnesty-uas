 EXTRA 32/94 - United States of America (USA): death penalty: imminent move to extend the Federal Death Penalty (includes correction) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 A major crime bill that would enlarge the scope of the federal death penalty to cover more than 60 crimes may soon become law. The bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 21 April 1994. A similar measure had been passed by the Senate in November 1993. A joint committee are presently considering both versions in order to agree on a final bill, which will then be sent for final approval. The expansion of the death penalty in the USA would be contrary to international human rights standards and treaties which encourage governments to restrict the use of the death penalty, with a view to its ultimate abolition."
