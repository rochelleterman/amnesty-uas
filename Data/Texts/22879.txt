 United Arab Emirates: Limited medical action: Amputations | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 According to a Reuters press report, two men convicted of piracy by a court in the United Arab Emirates were sentenced on 11 March 1993 to punitive amputation of one leg and one hand. They apparently have the right to appeal against the sentence. AI believes such punishment to be cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and as such to be prohibited by international human rights agreements. AI is also concerned about the possible role of medical professionals in the administration of such punishments."
