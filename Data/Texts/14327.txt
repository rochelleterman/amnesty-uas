 Turkey: Freedom of expression/torture/prisoners of        conscience | Amnesty International 
 A new version of the Turkish Penal Code (TPC) currently before the Turkish parliament for approval may be used to unnecessarily restrict the right to freedom of expression and could result in people being jailed as prisoners of conscience. It also leaves open the possibility of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation within the law, and retains obstacles to prosecutions for torture.
