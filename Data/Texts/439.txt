 40 members and supporters of the Social Democratic Front (SDF), including Alhadji Sani, SDF Provincial Coordinator for Central Province, and Prince Fesco William Manga, SDF Divisional Coordinator for Fako Division, South-West Province: Some 40 members and supporters of the main opposition party, the SDF, have been arrested and detained in the period surrounding the parliamentary elections which took place on 17 May. There is concern that the prison conditions they are being held in amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and that there is serious risk to their health. Most, if not all, appear to be prisoners of conscience.
