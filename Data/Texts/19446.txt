 Chad: Families evicted despite promises from mayor | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Over 670 people have been forcibly evicted and their homes destroyed in Nâ€™Djamena, the capital of Chad, to enable the construction of a hotel to take place. This is despite reassurances from the local Mayor that they would be allowed enough time to find alternative accommodation. The former residents of the site are now sleeping under nearby trees."
