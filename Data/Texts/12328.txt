 Mohammad Yasir Yusoff, Zainal Abu Bakar, Taufik Afizal Zainal Joned, Siapul Abdullah, Nikli bin Jusut, Zulkisli bin Rasjid, Busri bin Mulid Junus, Munzir bin Jusuf and others: On 25 December 1996, 40 asylum-seekers from Indonesia's Aceh province in Sumatra attempted to enter six embassies in the Malaysian capital. According to reported statements of embassy officials, the asylum-seekers were not agressive and were seeking political asylum, claiming they had been tortured by the Indonesian army because of their links to the separatist Aceh Merdeka Movement and that they would be persecuted if returned to Indonesia. They were also protesting Malaysia's attempts to forcibly return 53 Acehnese asylum-seekers the previous day.
