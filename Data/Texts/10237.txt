"Venezuela: Fear for safety/Death threats, Mariela Mendoza and members of her family 
 Venezuela: Fear for safety/Death threats, Mariela Mendoza and members of her family | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is extremely concerned for the safety of Mariela Mendoza and that of her family after she was shot outside her home on 16 July by an unidentified gunman. She had been a witness to the alleged police killings of her three brothers and prior to the shooting had received death threats presumably from the police officers implicated in the case or individuals acting on their behalf.
