 Nigeria: Fear of ill-treatment / possible prisoner of conscience: Ladi Olorunyomi (f) | Amnesty International 
 Ladi Olorunyomi, a 35-year-old journalist and wife of exiled journalist Dapo Olorunyomi, was arrested on 20 March by officers from the Directorate of Military Intelligence. She has since been detained incommunicado without charge or trial at DMI headquarters in Apapa, Lagos. There is concern that she may be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely on account of her relationship with Dapo Olorunyomi.
