 Maldives: Fear for safety: Aminath Najeeb (f), human rights defender; editor of newspaper Minivan

 | Amnesty International 
 Human rights defender Aminath Najeeb is the editor of the newspaper Minivan, which has been critical of the government. The authorities are now preparing to detain her, which would put her at risk of severe ill-treatment. If she is detained for two weeks or more, she will not be legally able to continue as the editor of a national newspaper: the government appears to be attempting to silence one of the few newspapers in the country that dares to criticise it.
