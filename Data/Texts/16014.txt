"Kazakstan: Further information on fear of imminent execution: Oleg Amiranovich Gorozashvili 
 NA 
 On 23 January 1997 a representative of the State Investigation Committee of Kazakstan (GSK) gave assurances that Oleg Amiranovich Gorozashvili would not be immediately executed until further information had been received about allegations of judicial error and had not been transferred to the prison in Almaty. However, on 27 January Amnesty International was again informed that he had been transferred to Almaty where his execution is to be carried out. Amnesty International is urging that his execution be stayed pending a full investigation into the alleged violations of judicial procedure and that the President reconsider his decision not to grant clemency.
