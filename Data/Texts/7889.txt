 AI is dismayed to learn that prisoners of conscience Maria Elena Foronda and Oscar Diaz Barboza were sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment on 1 March 1995. They are accused of having links to the armed opposition group MRTA. AI considers both to be prisoners of conscience because there appears to be no credible evidence of them having any links to the MRTA and the charges they face appear to be politically motivated. AI is calling for their immediate and unconditional release."
