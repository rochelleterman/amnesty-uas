 Nyi Nyi Naing, Tin Aye, Kyi Kyi Win (f), Ma Thida Myint (f), Ko Khin Maung Oo (released); Zaw Win, Tin Hla, Kyaw Soe, Thi Thi Aung (f), Ma Cho (f), Khin Mar Yee (f), U Khine Ko Oo (sentenced): Amnesty International has learned that the first five people named above, all National League for Democracy (NLD) youth members, were released on 23 December 1996. On 18 January 1997 the State Law and Order Restoration Council announced that they had sentenced 20 people to seven years' imprisonment for incitement during the December 1996 student demonstrations. There is concern that they may not have received a fair trial, and that the authorities may have used the law to criminalize peaceful opposition activity.
