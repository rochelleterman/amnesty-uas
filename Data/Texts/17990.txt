 Jordan: Death penalty: Sa'id al-Qashash | Amnesty International 
 Sa'id al-Qashash was sentenced to death on 30 November 1998 by the Amman Criminal Court after being found guilty of murdering 12 people. AI recognizes the horror that must be felt at such killings but opposes the death penalty in all cases and is calling for the commutation of the death sentence.
