 AI is concerned about reports that prison guards attempted forcibly to feed Hamma Hammami although he had expressed his clear refusal to be given nutrition, as he was on hunger strike. Hamma Hammami sustained injuries during his attempts to resist force-feeding. He ended his hunger strike on 20 December 1994."
