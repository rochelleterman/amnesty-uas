 Bahrain: Death penalty: 'Issa Ahmad Hassan Qambar | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI fears that 'Issa Hassan Qambar may be at risk of imminent execution if his death sentence is ratified by the Amir of Bahrain. He was sentenced to death by the Bahraini High Criminal Court on 4 July 1995, after being convicted of the murder of a police sergeant. As far as AI knows, the Amir of Bahrain has not yet ratified the sentence. AI is also concerned that the defendant was tried and convicted by a court following procedures which fail to meet international standards for fair trial; there are also fears that he may have been convicted on the basis of a confession extracted by torture."
