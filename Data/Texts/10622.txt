 China/Uzbekistan: Further information on fear of torture or ill-treatment/forcible return/fear of death penalty: Husein Dzhelil (m) | Amnesty International 
 Husein Dzhelil, aged 38, Canadian citizen, has reportedly been tortured in detention in China. According to those close to him, he has claimed that he was tortured after his extradition to China in June 2006, including by being starved and deprived of sleep during the first fifteen days of his imprisonment. He has also claimed that Chinese authorities threatened that he would ""disappear"" and ""be buried alive"" unless he signed a document. This document was later held up as a confession, although Husein Dzhelil reportedly later claimed he did not know what he had signed.
