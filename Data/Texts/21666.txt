 Valeri Pal has been sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment for stealing property from his workplace at an oil-refinery in the Caspian port city of Turkmenbashi. Valeri Pal’s supporters believe the case against him was fabricated to punish him for his social activism and contacts with human rights defenders abroad. Amnesty International continues to be seriously concerned about his health."
