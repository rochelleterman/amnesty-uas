 Egypt: Health concern / possible prisoner of conscience: 'Adel Hussein | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is seriously concerned about the continued detention of 'Adel Hussein, a journalist and the Secretary General of the Labour Party. AI believes that he may be a prisoner of conscience. He was arrested on 24 December 1994 and allegedly denied medication and a blanket at the police station in Misr al-Gadida. He was then interrogated by the State Security Procuracy and given a 15-day detention order. He was apparently arrested because of his association with al-Gama'a al-Islamiya. 'Adel Hussein reportedly suffers from heart disease and angina."
