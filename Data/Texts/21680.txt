 ""Justice only in heaven"" - End the death penalty in Uzbekistan | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 In November 2003 AI launched a series of actions including this web action to draw attention to the        findings of AI's report 'Justice only in Heaven' - the    death penalty in Uzbekistan and to urge the Uzbek         authorities to end the death penalty in their country.    Since the launch of the action there have been a number   of positive developments. The death sentences of two of   the men featured in this action - Evgeny Gugnin and Abror Isaev - have been commuted to imprisonment and the        authorities have given assurances that Iskander           Khudoberganov and Nodirbek Karimov will not be executed   while their cases are under consideration by the United   Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC)."
