 There is concern at reports that political prisoners in Jaw Prison no 1, including those named above, were tortured after a radio was discovered during a cell inspection on 9 April. They were then transferred to Al-Qala'a Prison where they are being held incommunicado, and where it is feared the torture is continuing. Some were transferred to hospital for urgent medical treatment, before being returned to Al-Qala'a Prison. In protest, at least 16 other political prisoners held in the prison began a hunger-strike on 9 April. Several of them were subsequently transferred to hospital following a deterioration in their condition."
