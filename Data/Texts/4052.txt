 Canada: Fear of forcible return / Fear of torture, Manickavasagam Suresh | Amnesty International 
 It is feared that Canadian authorities may return a Tamil man, Manickavasagam Suresh, to Sri Lanka, where he would be at grave risk of torture. The Supreme Court of Canada is expected to rule in his appeal in early January 2002. If the Court rules against him he will be at risk of immediate deportation.
