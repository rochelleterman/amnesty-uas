 Abdel Wahid Mohamed Ahmed Nour, Nafir El Din Tampour,     Ahmed Ibrahim and 63 others were arrested between July    and August in Zalingei, Tour and Nyartati in Western      Darfur province, and Golou in Jebel Mara province.   
All have been released, except Dawood Haroon, who is      reportedly being held by the security forces in the town  of Zalingei, Western Darfur. Dawood Haroon, who was       tortured previously, is apparently detained incommunicado without charge. Amnesty International is extremely        worried about his state of health resulting from his      previous torture and fears that he is at risk of further  ill-treatment or torture."
