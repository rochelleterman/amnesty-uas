 UA 138/94 - USA (Texas): death penalty: Larry Anderson, Paul Rougeau | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Larry Anderson is scheduled to be executed on 26 April and Paul Rougeau on 3 May in Texas. There is concern that Larry Anderson's trial lawyer failed to present mitigating evidence about his disturbed mental state, and had allegedly frequently failed to represent capital defendants adequately. Larry Anderson, white, was sentenced to death in February 1983 for the murder of a white woman. An appeal for a stay of execution was dismissed by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on 1 April 1994. Paul Rougeau, black, was sentenced to death on 28 October 1983 for the murder of a black male. According to information received, he was tried and sentenced to death by an all-white jury."
