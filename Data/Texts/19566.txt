 The work of 29 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is at risk of being halted in Masvingo, Zimbabwe, after an announcement by the local governor ordering the suspension of their operations. Many of these organizations work with people living with HIV/AIDS or provide relief to residents affected by the frequent droughts in the province."
