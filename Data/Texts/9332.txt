 USA (Texas): Further information on death penalty / legal concern: James Lee Clark (m) | Amnesty International 
 James Clark, white, aged 38, was executed in Texas in the early evening of 11 April 2007. He was sentenced to death in May 1994 for  the rape and murder of 17-year-old Shari Catherine Crews  in June 1993. His clemency petition had  sought the        commutation of his death sentence to    life imprisonment on the grounds that he had mental       retardation. The Texas     Board of Pardons and Paroles   rejected clemency, and       Governor Rick Perry failed   to intervene.
