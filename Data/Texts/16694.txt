 The death sentences passed on the four people named above and will not be subject to further review. The three men currently held in detention could be executed at any time. All four were tried by the Supreme Military Court on 21 August 1993 and charged with membership of an illegal organization, ""Al-Shawqiyyin"", and committing murders. All the above were sentenced to death by a military court, even though all are civilians. "
