 Beko Ransome-Kuti, Femi Falana and Chief Gani Fawehinmi, human rights activists and leading members of the Campaign for Democracy, remain imprisoned in Kuje prison, Abuja, despite a court ruling that they should be released on bail. The three were charged on 12 July with sedition and conspiracy. On 28 July bail was granted, but they are now being held under the State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree no 2, 1984, which permits administrative detention for renewable periods of six weeks. They have no recourse to a court to challenge their continuing detention without trial. Alhaji Lamidi Adedibu, a prominent member of the Social Democratic Party arrested on 20 July, is also believed to be still detained in Abuja without charge or trial. All four are prisoners of conscience. "
