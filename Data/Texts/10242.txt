 Daniel Jose Urbano Frisneda, arbitrarily arrested and allegedly beaten in incommunicado detention, is now reportedly being denied medical care in a prison notorious for its appalling conditions. Administratively detained under a law which infringes international standards for a fair trial, he should be immediately released and given the medical attention he needs."
