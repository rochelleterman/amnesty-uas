"Mexico: Fear for safety 
 Mexico: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Human rights activist Gustavo Jimânez Pârez was severely beaten on 20 November, by six men who forced their way into his house and threatened to kill him. He and his housemate, Gabriel RamÁrez, have recently been involved in exposing alleged official corruption in the distribution of humanitarian relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan, which struck Southern Mexico in October. Both men are members of a grassroots organization promoting social activism called Alianza CÁvica-Chiapas (Civic Alliance-Chiapas). Amnesty International believes this may be the reason for the attack, and fears that both men are in danger.
