 'Ali Ahmad Kadhem al-Muttaqawi, Jassim Hassan Mansour al-Khayat, Hussein Ahmad al-Mudhifa, Hussein Yousif Ibrahim, 'Ali Ahmad Kazem 'Abd 'Ali, 'Abbas 'Ali Ahmad Habil and at least 28 others: The six men named above are among a group of at least 34 people who are reported to have ""confessed"" their involvement in an Iranian-backed plot to overthrow the Bahraini Government. There is concern that the ""confessions"" may have been extracted under pressure, as a result of torture or ill-treatment. The men are being held incommunicado. There is further concern that their ""confessions"" were broadcast on television and may prejudice the outcome of a trial.
