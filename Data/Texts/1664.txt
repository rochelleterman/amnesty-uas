 Wale Shittu, Femi Adenuga and Emmanuel Nweke were released on bail in early August 1993. The three men, who all work for the Civil Liberties Organization (CLO) were arrested by police on 2 July and after being held without charge or trial at the State Investigation and Intelligence Bureau (SIIB), Alagbon Close, Lagos, were reportedly later charged with sedition. Amnesty International believes they were arrested because of their peaceful political activities and is now calling for all charges against them to be dropped. "
