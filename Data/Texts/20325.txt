 Mexico: Ending the brutal cycle of violence against women in Mexico - Closing text

 NA 
 The ongoing impunity around the brutal pattern of         violence against women in Ciudad Ju√°rez and Chihuahua has persisted since the early 1990s.  In spite of intense     national and international pressure and the Mexico        Federal Government's implementation in 2003 and 2004 of a programme of measures to prevent and prosecute acts of    violence against women, justice for the victims and       families is still yet to be achieved.  Proper             investigations into cases are necessary and the           perpetrators must be brought to justice.                  "
