 Brazil: Further information on fear of unfair trial: Jose Rainha Junior | Amnesty International 
 There is concern that Jose Rainha Junior, a national leader of the Landless Rural Workers' Movement, MST, was unfairly tried and convicted of murder on 11 June 1997. He was sentenced to twenty-six and half years' imprisonment on charges which appear to have been politically motivated. His appeal has been set for 16 September 1997.
