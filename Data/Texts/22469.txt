 Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories: Palestinian properties at risk of demolition | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 18 September, the Israeli military served three “stop work” orders against four domestic structures belonging to three Palestinian Bedouin families in the Tubas district in the occupied West Bank. These orders precede demolition orders, so the properties could be destroyed at any time. The villages are in “Area C” where the Israeli authorities effectively prohibit any Palestinian construction.
