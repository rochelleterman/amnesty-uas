 The official Committee of Inquiry into the incident on 4 January 1993 when the security forces shot at a student demonstration at Addis Ababa university, began its investigations in March 1993. The committeee has not yet completed its inquiry, but has taken or summoned evidence from a number of people. It has said that it has received no evidence of more than one death by shooting, Tesfahun Worku, and that no witness has been able to name any other student who was killed. Neither Amnesty International nor any others have yet been able to identify any other student killed, but there seems to be reliable evidence that many more people were wounded than the official police number of 13. There are continued concerns about procedural and substantive aspects of the inquiry. "
