 West Africa: Fear of refoulement: Refugees from Liberia on board the Bulk Challenge may be denied right to seek asylum | Amnesty International 
 Some 3,500 refugees from the war in Liberia, who fled on the freighter Bulk Challenge, are in danger of being forcibly returned to Liberia where their lives may be at risk. They have already been refused the right to seek asylum in Cote d'Ivoire and may be denied this right in Ghana, in violation of international law.
