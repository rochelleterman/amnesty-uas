 USA (Tennessee): Death penalty/Imminent execution: Daryl Keith Holton (m) | Amnesty International 
 Daryl Holton, aged 45, is scheduled to be executed in Tennessee on 12 September. He was sentenced to death in 1999 for the murder of his three young sons and their half-sister in 1997. He has effectively waived his appeals, although he has characterized his approach as one of ""selective procedural default"".
