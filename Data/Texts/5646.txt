 Ecuador: Fear for safety/possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Ciro Guzm‡n Aldas, Luis Villacis Maldonado and Jos_       Ch‡vez were detained by the security   forces on 15       January 2000, apparently only because they   called for   President Jamil Mahuad to resign over          Ecuador's  economic crisis. Amnesty International          therefore believes they may be prisoners of conscience    and is    seriously concerned for their safety, in                  particular that they may be ill-treated and tortured.
