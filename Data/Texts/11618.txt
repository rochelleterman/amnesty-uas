 East Timor: Fear of torture: several East Timorese, names unknown | Amnesty International 
 Four, or possibly six, East Timorese have been arrested following the killing of a member of the ruling party, Golkar, on 25 April 1997. The lack of information on the identities and whereabouts of the detainees has raised concerns that they may be subjected to ill-treatment or torture in custody.
