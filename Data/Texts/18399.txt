 Saudi Arabia: Preventive death penalty action | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned at the increased use   of the death penalty in Saudi Arabia in recent months. On 26 October 1999 it was announced that Dhafir bin ?Abd     al-Rahman bin Dhafir al-Jirman   al-Ahmari, a Saudi       Arabian national, had been executed.The following day     three Pakistani nationals were executed in Mecca. Amnesty International fears that dozens more people are   facing  imminent execution after trials which do not meet         internationally recognized standards.
