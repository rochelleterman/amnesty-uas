 On 3 August several hundred campesinos, peasants, members of the Comite de Unidad Campesina (CUC), Consejo Nacional e Desplazados de Guatemala (CONDEG) and Coordinadora Nacional de Viudas de Guatemala (CONAVIGUA), staged a peaceful demonstration to protest against alleged harassment of the people of Colotenango by members of the army and the Civil Defence Patrols. When gathered in the village of El Naranjal, Colotenango, Huehuetenanago, members of the Civil Defence reportedly opened fire indiscriminately against the crowd, killing Juan Pablo Chanay, and wounding several others. There are unconfirmed reports that at least two other demonstrators were killed in the incident. "
