 NA 
 Lorna Redell Jackson García and Juana Leticia Maldonaldo Gutíerrez have been shot at and threatened with death, apparently in connection with their work as leaders of the motor vehicle workers' trade union SITRAFL. Other members of the SITRAFL Executive Committee have received threatening phone calls. All of them are in grave danger, and they have gone into hiding."
