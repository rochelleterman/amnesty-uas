 The above-named retired Inspector of the Department of Land Administration in the West Bank and father of five, remains ""disappeared"" more than three months after he was reportedly taken into custody by the Palestinian military intelligence on 21 June 1997. Concern for his safety is heightened by the recent deaths of four Palestinian land dealers, and the detention and reported ill-treatment of others.
