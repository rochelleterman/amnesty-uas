 Tunisia: Further information on prisoner of conscience / health concern: Khemais Ksila, human rights defender | Amnesty International 
 The trial of Khemais Ksila has been postponed from 21 January to 28 January, at the request of his defence lawyers who have been prevented from preparing an adequate defence as a result of the refusal of the judicial authorities to grant the majority of the lawyers visiting permits over the past several weeks. AI continues to assert that Khemais Ksila is a prisoner of conscience.
