 The above-named men are scheduled to be executed in Pennsylvania in July and August 1995. They were all sentenced to death for murder, at separate trials. Scott Blystone, a Native American, reportedly has a documented history of child abuse; he currently has no attorney to file his appeals. Ronald Logan, black, has a history of mental illness. Leon Moser is refusing to file appeals and will allow the state to carry out his execution. There is concern about aspects of the trial of Mumia Abu-Jamal; these are now subject to a habeas corpus petition."
