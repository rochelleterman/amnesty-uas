 On 8 May 2012, eight Romani families, numbering some 50 individuals, moved with a police escort, from the premises of the Albanian Romani Association in the Albanian capital Tirana, to buildings which were partially renovated for their permanent accommodation. Their housing remains severely inadequate and there are fears for the familiesâ€™ safety."
