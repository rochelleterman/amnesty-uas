 Uzbekistan: Further information on: Fear of imminent execution/torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has learnt that a prisoner on death row, Akhrorkhuzha Tolipkhuzhaev, was executed at the beginning of March, even though the Uzbekistani authorities assured the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Committee that he was still alive on 21 March 2005. This heightens fears that Farid Nasibullin could be executed at any time.
