 The three people above are lawyers from Gabinete de Apoio Juridico a Organizacoes Populares, GAJOP, a human rights organization that gives legal advice to poor people and community organizations in Recife, Pernambuco state. There have been death threats made against them since they denounced several cases of corruption within the state judiciary. On 23 July while driving home, Jayme Benvenuto de Lima Jr, coordinator of GAJOP, was ambushed and threatened with a gun by two unknown assailants. When the other car made off, he was shot at, but was unhurt. "
