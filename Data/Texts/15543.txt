 A pacifist conscientious objector, Aleksandr Chizhikov's appeal against a one-year sentence for refusing his call-up papers was not upheld by Moscow City Court on 26 May 1993. However the court did change his sentence from one year's imprisonment to a conditional sentence of one year. He intends to appeal this ruling to the Supreme Court. "
