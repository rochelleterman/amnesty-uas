 Iran: Fear for safety/torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Retired teacher Mostafa Piran was forcibly evicted from his government-owned apartment on 6 July, together with his family. He is now reportedly held in Evin Prison, in Tehran, where he has reportedly been ill-treated and possibly tortured. It appears that he has not been informed of any charges against him, nor allowed to see a lawyer.
