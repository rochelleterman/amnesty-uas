 Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): No justice for rape victim: Bitondo Nyumba | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Justice has yet to be served in the case of Bitondo Nyumba,a 56-year-old woman who died as a result of        injuries she suffered when she was attacked and raped by  government soldiers in May 2005. But with a new           government recently taking office in the Democratic       Republic of Congo (DRC), now is the time to renew calls   for justice."
