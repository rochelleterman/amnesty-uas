 Since the issue of the original action in November 1994, further incidents have greatly increased concern for those named above. On 28 February 1995, Debora Guzman Chupen, a trade union leader and wife of Felix Gonzalez, was abducted. She claims to have been drugged, struck with a solid object and threatened with death during her abduction. She was released on 1 March. On 4 March, heavily armed men drove past the factory where the trade unionists were gathered and fired shots in the air."
