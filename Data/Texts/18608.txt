 AI has recently received reports indicating that the health of Aktham Nu'aysa, Nizar Nayyuf and 'Afif Muzhir has improved. All had previously suffered health problems, in two cases allegedly due to the effects of torture. AI has also learned that all ten prisoners named above, who are currently held in Saidnaya Prison, have been allowed family vistits.
