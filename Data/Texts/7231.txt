 Mexico: fear of torture / fear of ""disappearance"": Alfredo Jimenez Santis, Mario Alvarez, Tojolabal Indians | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The two men named above have not been seen since they were reportedly detained by members of the army in Ejido Chiapas on 9 February 1995. They are Tojolabal Indians and both members of the Independent Union of Rural and Peasant Workers (CIOAC). Their detention would appear to be part of the current official clampdown against alleged members and sympathizers of the EZLN. Concern about them has been heightened by reports of other detainees being tortured in detention."
