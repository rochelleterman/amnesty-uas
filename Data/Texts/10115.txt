 Nine Guantænamo Bay detainees (Omar Khadr, Ali Hamza Ahmed Suleiman al Bahlul, Jabran Said bin Al Qahtani, Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, Sufyian Barhoumi, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, David Matthew Hicks and Binyam Ahmed Muhammad) have been named under a US presidential order to be tried by military commissions, which Amnesty International considers to be inherently flawed and unable to provide fair trials in line with internationally recognized standards.
