 Military authorities in the USA have approved a three-month reduction in the prison sentence of conscientious objector Travis Bishop. He was imprisoned for one year for refusing to serve with the army in Afghanistan because of his religious beliefs. It is likely that he will be released next month. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience. "
