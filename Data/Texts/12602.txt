 Amnesty International has been informed that Shiva Prasad Gautam was released on 5 December 2003. He had reportedly been beaten during the early stages of his detention. Amnesty International is increasingly concerned about the safety of all the other people especially in the light of reports that detainees in army custody are routinely subjected to torture and ill-treatment.
