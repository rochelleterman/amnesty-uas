 Barbados:Fear of imminent execution/Legal Concern | Amnesty International 
 Michael McDonald Huggins, Frederick Benjamin Atkins, Lennox Ricardo Boyce, Jeffrey Joseph are scheduled to be executed by hanging on 2 July. Their appeals for clemency were rejected, despite the fact that legal appeals for all four men have not yet been completed. If carried out, the executions would violate international law and thus constitute murder.
