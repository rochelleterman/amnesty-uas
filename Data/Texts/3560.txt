 Eritrea: Fear of torture or ill-treatment/incommunicado   detention/detention without charge | Amnesty International 
 Several hundred relatives of people who have evaded or deserted from military conscription have reportedly been arrested in the Debub region of southern Eritrea since 15 July. They are held incommunicado, many in harsh conditions, and are at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Some reportedly began a hunger strike in protest at their detention. Amnesty International fears that the arrest campaign could be extended to all other parts of the country.
