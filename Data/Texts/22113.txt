 Three women and two men are facing execution for drug trafficking in Iran, possibly as soon as 26 June, after unfair trials. They have not had the opportunity to appeal against their convictions and sentences. Their requests for pardon have been rejected on two occasions. Amnesty International is calling for the immediate commutation of their death sentences. "
