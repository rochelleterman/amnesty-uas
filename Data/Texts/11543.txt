 AI fears that Karta Cayhadi may be executed on or around 27 March 1995 in Surakarta, Central Java. He has been on death row for almost 5 years. He was convicted of murder and robbery and sentenced to death in September 1990. His appeal to the Supreme Court was refused and it appears that he lodged his appeal for presidential clemency without any legal assistance. A recent press report has stated that he may have failed to use a futher appeal mechanism available after his petition for presidential clemency was rejected."
