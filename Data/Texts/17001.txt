 Iran: Further information on Incommunicado detention/ Fear of torture or ill-treatment/ Possible prisoner of conscience: Sherko Jihani (m) 
 | Amnesty International 
 Journalist and human rights defender Sherko Jihani has been transferred to Mahabad Central Prison in northwestern Iran. He had previously been held incommunicado at an unknown location, believed to be a detention facility belonging to the Ministry of Intelligence. He is believed to have been tortured and he is said to be in poor health. He may have been detained for his peaceful activities in defence of the rights of Iran's Kurdish minority, in which case Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience.
