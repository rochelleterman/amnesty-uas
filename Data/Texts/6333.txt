 AI is seriously concerned for the safety of Lisbeth Valenzuela Bustamante and Luis Samayoa Barrera, two first-year law students at the Universidad de San Carlos. Reports indicate that they have been under surveillance since 17 August 1995 and both have received threats. It appears that the reason they are being targeted may be related to Luis Samayoa's participation in an action protesting about the possible extrajudicial execution of another student."
