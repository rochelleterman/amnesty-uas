 Amnesty International is concerned about reports that the above, a former secondary school director, and more than 80 members of the majority Hutu ethnic group, sentenced to death in early 1996 in connection with killings of the minority Tutsi ethnic group, could be executed. They were sentenced to death during unfair trials.
