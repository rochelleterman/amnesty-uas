 Indonesia: Fear of torture / ill-treatment: Haji Jafar bin Adam | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of Haji Jafar bin Adam, Islamic Preacher and trader, who has been held in military custody in the province of North Aceh, Indonesia, since 17 November 1997 where it is feared he may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment. It appears he was arrested by members of the Special Forces Command, Kopassus, due to the local authorities' perception that the agreement about the scheduling of the Friday prayer services had been breached, after work commitments prevented him from delivering his scheduled service.
