 Journalist Olga Kitova is facing detention and possible imprisonment, apparently because of newspaper articles in which she alleged official corruption. She suffers ill-health and Amnesty International is concerned that her life would be in danger if she were again detained, and would consider her a possible prisoner of conscience.
