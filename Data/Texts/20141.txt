 Santos Feliciano Aguilar Álvares, a member of the Afro-descendant Garífuna community of San Juan, was abducted, beaten and threatened with death on 5 June 2008 by up to 10 men, allegedly private security guards working for a local real estate company. A few hours before the incident, he had taken part in a community assembly attended by representatives of the local real estate company who he accused of pressurizing Garífuna people to sell their land."
