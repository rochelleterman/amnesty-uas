 The five people named above have been taken into custody on 2 June 1995. The authorities have acknowledged the detention of Salih Bal, his wife, Hilal, who is 8 months pregnant, Zelal Boga and Mehmet Sanri, who are being held at the Anti-Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters. AI fears they may face torture in incommunicado detention. There is particular concern about Rifat Yuksekkaya, whose detention has been denied by the authorities."
