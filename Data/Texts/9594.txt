 Mohammed C., a Chadian national born in Saudi Arabia, has been in indefinite US military custody without charge or trial for three and a half years. It is believed that he was 14 years old when he was detained in October 2001 in Pakistan. He was handed over to the US authorities then taken to Afghanistan before being transferred to Guantænamo in January 2002. Amnesty International believes that his conditions of detention amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and that he and the other Guantænamo detainees are unlawfully detained.
