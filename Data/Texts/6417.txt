 On 23 July 1999, Guatemala's Ninth Court of Appeals in    Antigua Guatemala ordered a re-trial in the case against  C?ndido Noriega. The court ruled that there had been      anomalies in the course of the April 1999 proceedings in  El Quich?, which had absolved Noriega for the second time of the charges against him. He will now remain in custody awaiting his third trial for alleged human rights crimes.
