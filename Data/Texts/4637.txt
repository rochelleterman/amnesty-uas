 Colombia: Fear for safety: Members of the human rights organisation ConsultorÃ­a para los Derechos Humanos y el Desplazamiento (CODHES) and other human rights groups

 | Amnesty International 
 A paramilitary group has sent death threats to a prominent human rights organisation which works on issues relating to communities forcibly displaced by the armed conflict. This is thought to be one of the army-backed groups that have supposedly demobilised, but are continuing to operate under new names. Amnesty International believes the organisation's members are in danger.
