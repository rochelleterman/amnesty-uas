 There is concern for the safety of the above named men, who are being held incommunicado in police custody under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act. The arrests in early January relate to an investigation into the murder of four people on 30 December 1993. There is concern at reports that at least one of the detainees, Theo Mabusela, the Chairperson of the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC) in the Western Cape Region, has been assaulted in custody. Under the provisions of Section 29, the police may detain a person incommunicado for interrogation purposes for 10-day periods renewable by the agreement of a Supreme Court Judge."
