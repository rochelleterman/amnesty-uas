 UA 297/93 - Colombia: fear for safety: Dr Rafael Barrios Mendivil | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Dr Rafael Barrios who has recently received telephone death threats and has been followed by security force agents. Dr Barrios is the president of the human rights lawyers association, Corporacion Colectivo de Abogados Jose Alvear Restrepo, and has worked on numerous important human rights cases in which members of the police and army are implicated. These include the killing of 17 people on a public transport bus in Los Uvos, Cauca department, on 7 April 1991 by members of the army, and the massacre of at least 20 Paez Indians on 16 December 1991 by members of the police. Two other lawyers working on behalf of the Paez Indians have been killed, apparently as a result of their work on the case. "
