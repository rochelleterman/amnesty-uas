 UA 448/94 - Ecuador: harassment / fear for safety: Hugo Espana Torres and human rights activists | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned for the safety of Hugo Espana Torres, a former police officer who is reportedly being subjected to repeated harassment and threats by civilian-dressed and uniformed members of the police in Quito. Hugo Espana played a key part in informing the authorities that police officers had been responsible for the ""disappearance"" of two brothers in 1988. AI is also concerned about numerous reports of harassment, apparently by the police, of human rights activists who are pressing the authorities to clarify unresolved cases of ""disappearance""."
