 Saiful Bahri, Mauli Iskandar and Maimun are now known to have been released in the evening of 26 June. They said that they had been detained at Aceh Besar District Military Command (Kodim), where the four others, Jafaruddin Fajar, Abdullah Abra, Zikri, and Syukriadi Syahputra, are still held. Relatives went back to the Kodim today, and were apparently told that the four were still detained there, but they were not allowed to see them.
