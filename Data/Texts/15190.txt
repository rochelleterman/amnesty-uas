 In a police operation which started on 27 September 1994, suspected supporters of the illegal Kurdish party PRK are being detained in Izmir. The above-named, with the exception of lawyer Riza Dinc, are being held at Izmir Police Headquarters. Riza Dinc is being held at Mersin Police Headquarters. It is feared that he is being detained under torture. Lawyers eventually got to speak to some of the detainees on 3 October. Gurbet Adibelli, who is pregnant, had reportedly been tortured. The detainees reportedly told the lawyers that they were on hunger strike and that their conditions of detention were poor."
