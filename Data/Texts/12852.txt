 Pakistan: Incommunicado Detention/Medical Concern/""Disappearance"" : KhalId Khawaja (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Khalid Khawaja, who has been actively involved in assisting the relatives of people who have ""disappeared"", was reportedly ""abducted"" by the security forces in the morning of 26 January. On 21 February he was granted bail, but that evening he was moved, reportedly to a different detention centre, where the authorities have denied having him in custody. His whereabouts are now unknown. He could only legally have been kept in custody after bail was granted if new charges had been brought against him, but none have been announced. Khalid Khawaja is diabetic and has reportedly been denied adequate medical care.
