 There is concern for the safety of child witnesses to the ""Candelaria massacre"" following reported government statements that after having identified the suspects in court, the children will be returned to the streets. There is no guarantee that they will be safe there as a number of witnesses to ""death squad"" style killings have been killed in the past in Rio de Janeiro after identifying suspects. They are currently held in the Witnesses Safe House. "
