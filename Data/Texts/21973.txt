 Iran: Death penalty/ stoning | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Abdollah Farivar Moghaddam was executed by hanging on 19 February 2009 in Sari Prison in northern Iran. Along with the others named in this action, he had been sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery, but his family was informed on 18 February that he was to be hanged the following day. Anti-stoning campaigners have expressed fears that the lives of other people sentenced to death by stoning could also be at imminent risk.  "
