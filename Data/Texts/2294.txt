 African National Congress (ANC) executive branch members and other residents of Appelbosch, Natal, have suffered repeated attacks by armed men over the last year. On 16 January 1993 Godfrey Maseko's home was fired on by armed men. On 12 July officers from the Internal Stability Unit of the South African Police (SAP) visited his home three times apparently in search of weapons. Godfrey Maseko, an executive committee member of the ANC branch in Appelbosch was not at home, but the police allegedly tortured his younger brother Sibongiseni Maseko and another youth at the house. On 22 September 1992 a group of armed men, including police, surrounded the home of Mkhanyisi Dlomo, the Appelbosch ANC branch chairperson. They shot dead his mother, and wounded Mkhanyisi Dlomo. He is still in hiding. "
