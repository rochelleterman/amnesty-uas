 UA 382/92 - Iran: fear of torture / death penalty: Abdollah Bagheri | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Abdollah Bagheri, a former member of the Kurdish opposition group Komala, was arrested at the beginning of November 1992 outside Mariwan, near the Iraq border. He was reportedly no longer a member of Komala at the time of his arrest, although he had been an active member of the organization for several years. The Information and Security Minister said on 7 November that an official of the ""Marxist Komala movement"" had been arrested and that a military group backed by ""counter-revolutionary elements"" had been dissolved and its members executed. The Komala official appears to be Abdollah Bagheri. AI fears that he may be in danger of ill-treatment or execution. "
