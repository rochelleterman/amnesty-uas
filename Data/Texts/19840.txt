 NA 
 The 170-strong Guarani-Kaiowá indigenous community of Pyelito Kue/Mbarakay – including 70 children – faces imminent eviction from their ancestral lands in Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. If they are evicted, they would end up living in extremely dangerous conditions, camped by the side of a road."
