 DRC: Further information on Fear of torture/""disappearance""/execution | Amnesty International 
 Over 100 people from the eastern region of Kivu, including Jean-Marie Rusimbuku, UN staff member; Jeanine Mukanirwa, human rights activist; and Aim_e Ntabarusha Mungu, a civil servant, are now detained incommunicado in government-controlled DRC. The majority are in unofficial security service detention centres where torture is routine. Several have reportedly ""disappeared"" since their arrest, and there have been persistent, but unconfirmed reports that some may have been extrajudicially executed.
