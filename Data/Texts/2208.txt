 Gladys Mokgoro, Jacob Mabona and two other residents of Mogogoe village near Mafikeng were shot and injured on 10 March 1994 by two unidentified white men in a moving vehicle. These shootings followed reports that Bophuthatswana's President indicated that he intended to ask supporters of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) to support his government in resisting pressures to participate in South Africa's elections. During the past week anonymous telephone callers claiming to be AWB members have made death threats against staff at the ANC's Mafikeng office, and in the early hours of 7 March, the ANC's office was damaged by a petrol bomb. There have also been reports of harassment in Mmabatho."
