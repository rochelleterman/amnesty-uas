 Burkina Faso: Possible extrajudicial executions: Blaise Sidiani, Emile Zigani | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 9 May 1995 in Garango, two school students, Blaise Sidiani, aged 18, and Emile Zigani, aged 14, were shot dead by security forces during a demonstration calling for increases in teachers' salaries. Their deaths have led to strikes and further demonstrations, and there are fears that further deaths will occur unless immediate steps are taken to curb excessive use of force by the security forces. On 15 May during a meeting of the National Association of Burkinabe Students (ANEB), the ANEB president was reportedly physically assaulted by members of the security forces."
