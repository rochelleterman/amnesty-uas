 UA 381/94 - Colombia: fear for safety: Olga Matilde Ortiz Solano, Ruth Rueda, and members of the National Federation of United Agricultural Unions (FENSUAGRO) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 10 October Olga Matilde Ortiz and Ruth Rueda were harassed and shot at while travelling from the municipality of Facatativa to Bogota. In the days before the attack, the car in which they had been travelling had reportedly been kept under surveillance whilst it was being used by a leader of FENSUAGRO. In recent weeks it has been reported that FENSUAGRO's headquarters and staff have been kept under surveillance. There are now fears for the safety of the two women and for members of FENSUAGRO."
