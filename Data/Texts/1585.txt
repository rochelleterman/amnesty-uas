 NA 
 Gbenga Adebusuyi, Bankole Akinrinade, Femi Akrinrinade, Philip Arogheo, Peter Ogunyamoju: There is concern for the safety of the above five men who have been detained, following reports that one of them, Gbenga Adebusyi, has been tortured at the Directorate of Military Intelligence headquarters in Apapa, Lagos. There is also concern that they may be prisoners of conscience, detained solely because they are relatives or friends, or relatives of friends, of retired Lieutenant-General Alani Akinrinade, a leading member of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) in exile. He has been publicly accused by the authorities of responsibility for bombings in Nigeria in 1996. The detainees are being held incommunicado and without charge.
