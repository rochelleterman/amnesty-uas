 NA 
 Some 72 families were forcibly evicted from a poor neighbourhood in the capital by around 300 police and military personnel on 15 October 2011. Since then they have been living in a camp nearby, where they have been harassed and attacked by the security forces who are guarding the area they were evicted from."
