 Israel: Fear of the legalization of torture | Amnesty International 
 In October 1999, a bill was introduced into Israel's      parliament, which would allow the General Security        Service to torture or ill-treat detainees during          interrogation. If the bill passes, Israel would be in     breach of the the Convention against Torture and Other    Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,      which it ratified in 1991.
