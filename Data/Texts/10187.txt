 Venezuela: Arbitrary arrest / fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Jorge Nieves, human rights defender, Leticia Echenique (f), human rights defender: AI is alarmed at the arbitrary arrest of the above, members of a non-governmental human rights organization based in Guasdualito, state of Apure, and is seriously concerned about their safety and that of other members of the Comite para la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos (CODEHUM). Guasdualito is within the so-called border security zones, where several constitutional guarantees remain suspended and security operations are under the command of the army. They were detained on 29 July at the local police intelligence agency, when they went to enquire about the conditions of detention of Silvano Rivero. Following their detention, the home of Jorge Nieves was raided without a warrant by the police.
