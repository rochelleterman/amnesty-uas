 Morocco: Further information on death penalty | Amnesty International 
 Stephane Ait Iddir, a French/Algerian national, Radouane Hamadi, a French/Algerian national, Hamal Marzoug, an Algerian national: The three men named above, who were sentenced to death in Fes on 28 January 1995, will have their case examined in cassation by the Supreme Court in Rabat on 24 December 1996. They were tried, with 14 others, in connection with several armed attacks in November 1993 and summer 1994, in which tourists were killed. AI has expressed its concern about allegations that some of the defendants were tortured in garde a vue detention and that their trial may not have been fair.
