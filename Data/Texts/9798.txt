 NA 
 Robert Shaw, scheduled to be executed in Missouri on 3 December 1992, has been granted a stay of execution. The stay was issued after the Missouri Department of Corrections issued a notice to the state governor that competency proceedings should be allowed to take place. A judge will decide whether to conduct a full competency hearing. A bill proposing to prohibit the execution of mentally retarded persons will be introduced into the state legislature in January 1993. "
