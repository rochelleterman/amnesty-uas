 EXTRA 04/94 - Turkey: fear of torture / health concern: Ahmet Aygun | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern for the safety of Ahmet Aygun who was detained in Istanbul on 19 January 1994. On the morning of 20 January he was brought home by plainclothes police who searched his house. According to his mother, Ahmet Aygun was in a poor state of health, and both of his arms appeared to have been broken. Since then he has been held in incommunicado detention, presumably at the Anti-Terror Branch of Istanbul Police Headquarters. The reason for his detention is unknown, and there is concern that he is being interrogated under torture."
