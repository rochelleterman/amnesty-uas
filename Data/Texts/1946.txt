 Rwanda: Fear of further deaths in custody: 16 detainees at Gitesi detention centre (dead); others held in overcrowded detention centres, especially in Kibuye Prefecture | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that 16 detainees died as a result of life threatening conditions in a communal detention centre in Giitesi commune, Kibuye Prefecture. The majority of prisoners in Rwanda are held, without charge or trial, in seriously overcrowded detention centres. Amnesty International fears that further deaths in detention will occur unless this issue is addressed.
