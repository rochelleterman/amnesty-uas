 Cuba: Arbitrary detention / harassment / possible prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Bernardo Fuentes Camblor, journalist, Magaly Pino Garcia, journalist, Jorge Enrique Rives, journalist (all three are members of Patria and the Cuban Concilium): Amnesty International is concerned that the above, who were arrested on 12 August 1996, could face imprisonment as prisoners of conscience or be forced into exile. These arrests are part of the recent crackdown by the Cuban Government which aims to prevent members of Concilio Cubano, of which Patria is a member, from freely exercising their rights to freedom of association, assembly and expression.
