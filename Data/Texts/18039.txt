 On 30 October 1993 the State Security Court will pass verdict on the 14 people accused of participation in an alleged assassination attempt on the former United States president, George Bush. There are fears that if convicted, 12 of the 14 could be sentenced to death. There is also concern that their trial has not met internationally recognised standards for a fair trial. "
