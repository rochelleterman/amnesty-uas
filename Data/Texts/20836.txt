 NA 
 A Chinese man, Wang Yang, could be executed within a week if China's Supreme People's Court (SPC) approves his death sentence. His case has been heard a total of nine times by different courts since he was first sentenced in 2003. China provides no clemency procedures for condemned prisoners after they have exhausted their appeals through the courts. "
