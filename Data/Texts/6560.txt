 Guatemala: Fear for safety: Sulma, other transvestite sex workers in  Guatemala City and members of Integral  Sexuality AIDS Support Organisation (OASIS)

 | Amnesty International 
 Transvestite sex worker Sulma (legal name Kevin Josuâ Alegria Robles) was shot in the head, allegedly by police, on 17 December, and remains in hospital in a serious condition. Another transvestite sex worker was killed in the attack. As Sulma witnessed the killing, the attackers are likely to attempt to silence her, but the authorities have not responded to requests to give her protection.
