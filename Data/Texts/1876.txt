 Rwanda: Further information on: fear for safety / fear of ill-treatment: Joseph Ruyenzi | Amnesty International 
 Jean-Paul Bizimana, Rwandese Minister of Information has stated, in a letter to AI, that Joseph Ruyenzi's arrest was not connected with his work as a journalist or his ethnic background, but that he was arrested on suspicion of acts of rape and mutilation he allegedly committed during the genocide of 1994. AI delegates visited Joseph Ruyenzi in Kigali Prison in May 1996 and he reported that he was not being ill-treated and he appeared to be in good health.
