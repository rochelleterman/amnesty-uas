 DRC:Torture / Death in custody | Amnesty International 
 A man has died at a security service detention centre  in the south-eastern part of the Democratic Republic of      Congo, after reportedly being tortured for several days.  Amnesty International is appalled by the death, and is    concerned that other detainees risk a similar fate,       particularly if no action is taken to bring the torturers to justice.
