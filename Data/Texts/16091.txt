 Tajikistan: Medical concern / political prisoner and new concern: death penalty / torture or ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Abdulkhafiz Abdullayev and five other men (new cases): AI is alarmed at reports that political prisoner Abdulkhafiz Abdullayev and five other men were sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of Tajikistan on 12 March 1998, apparently without right of appeal.  They may face imminent execution unless the President of Tajikistan commutes their death sentences.There is also grave concern that Abdulkhafiz Abdullayev is critically ill with cancer and that he is not receiving the necessary medical attention his condition requires.
