 Haiti: Fear for Safety -  Ossagnol SERVIL | Amnesty International 
 A judge has been forced out of office by the local mayor, who has threatened to kill him. He is now in hiding, in fear for his life. Ossagnol Servil was justice of the peace, where he issued an arrest warrant for two men accused of theft. The men supporters of the town's mayor, Wilo Joseph, reportedly threatened to kill M. Servil. In late October the mayor and his supporters led a demonstration outside the courthouse, ransacking the judge's offices and reportedly demanding that he be sacked and replaced with someone more sympathetic to the mayor's political party. M. Servil has been dismissed by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security.
