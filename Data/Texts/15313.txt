 Fears for the safety of Mahfus Tanriverdi, reportedly in unacknowledged detention in Diyarbakir since 26 October 1995, are heightened by the fact that two of his brothers ""disappeared"" in 1994. After receiving reports that one of them was recently sighted in military custody, AI is seeking information as to the whereabouts of all three brothers as a matter of urgency."
