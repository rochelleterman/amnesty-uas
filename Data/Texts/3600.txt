 UA 307/92 - Argentina: fear of ""disappearance"": Pablo Cristian Guardatti | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Pablo Cristian Guardatti, aged 21, was reportedly taken to ""La Estanzuela"" police unit on 24 May 1992. He and some friends had left a disco and were reportedly throwing stones at one another while walking, one of which hit a passer-by, believed to be a policeman in civilian clothes. This man chased the youths, firing into the air; he reportedly caught Pablo Guardatti, handcuffed him and took him to the police unit without identifying himself. Pablo Cristian Guardatti's whereabouts remain unknown. A witness reported seeing him in unofficial detention at the end of June but the police deny the detention. A habeas corpus petition was rejected. Four policemen have since been charged with ""kidnapping"". Witnesses in this case have reportedly been threatened. "
