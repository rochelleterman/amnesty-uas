 Equatorial Guinea: Further Information on: Fear for safety/fear of torture/medical concern
 | Amnesty International 
 Jer—nimo Mb‡ Obama reportedly was taken to hospital in Malabo on the night of 13 July, as he had become very ill, reportedly as a result of torture. He had reportedly been badly tortured following his arrest. He had also apparently suffered a severe attack of malaria. Prison guards forcibly removed him from hospital two days later, without medical authorisation, and took him back to prison. He and the others arrested on 27 June are reportedly still held incommunicado. Each man is apparently allowed one bottle of water and two bread rolls every five days.
