 UA 405/93 - Turkey: threat of forced eviction and destruction of Christian village (Hassana village - Kosrali koyu in Turkish) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is gravely concerned about the threatened eviction and destruction by Turkish security forces of the village of Hassana. Villagers have been given until 20 November to leave. The Christian village of Hassana lies in an area where PKK guerrillas are very active: most of the neighbouring villages have been evacuated and destroyed. The villagers of Hassana are not armed and have attempted to stay outside the conflict but have come under pressure from the guerrillas to supply provisions. Villagers have been repeatedly detained by the security forces on charges of supporting the PKK. AI is concerned that injury and loss of life may result if the forced evacuation and destruction of Hassana goes ahead."
