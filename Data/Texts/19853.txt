 Canada: Prisoner of Conscience: James Corey Glass (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Canadian authorities intend to deport US serviceman James Corey Glass on 10 July 2008. He fled to Canada to avoid being sent back to Iraq because of his conscientious objection to the war there. If they deport him, he risks being court-martialled and jailed for between one and five years. Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience."
