 NA 
 Ken Saro-Wiwa was arrested in the early hours of 22 May 1994 at his house in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. According to officials he is being held in connection with the murder of four leading members of the Ogoni ethnic group. He has not so far been charged with any offence or given access to his family or a lawyer. It is believed that these accusations are unfounded and that Ken Saro-Wiwa is a prisoner of conscience."
