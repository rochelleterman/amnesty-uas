 On 27 November 1994 the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported that Ali Akbar Saidi-Sirjani had died of a heart attack in an unspecified Tehran hospital that same day. He was arrested on 14 March and is believed to have been held incommunicado under house arrest. Amnesty International is gravely concerned by his death and is calling for a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding it. His family have said that they had no knowledge of him having any prior history of heart trouble."
