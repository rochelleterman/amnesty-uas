 Uzbekistan: Fear for safety / ill-treatment in custody: Mikhail Ardzinov | Amnesty International 
 There is grave concern for the safety of Mikhail Ardzinov, the chairman of the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan (NOPCHU). During a search of his apartment by officers from the Tashkent City Department of Internal Affairs (GUVD) on 25 June 1999, he was detained and reportedly seriously assaulted by        plainclothes GUVD officers, sustaining injuries including  two broken ribs, concussion and contused kidneys, which   were detailed in a medical certificate issued by the      medical officer of the United States Embassy in          Tashkent. He has been called for questioning again at the GUVD, but has reportedly gone on hunger-strike and is     refusing to leave his apartment.
