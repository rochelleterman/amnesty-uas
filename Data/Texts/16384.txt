 The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYRM): fear of return: Ethnic Albanians from Kosovo province of Serbia | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 There is concern at recent reports that police in the FYRM have been carrying out systematic round-ups of ethnic Albanians, who are apparently thought to come from Kosovo province of Serbia in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). The round-ups have occurred in and around the town of Tetovo, but it is likely that similar actions are occurring in other areas. Those involved appear to be mainly young men of military age, many of whom may have fled to the FYRM to avoid military service. There is concern that if they are returned they will be at risk of ill-treatment, torture or other violations."
