 Xanana Gusmao, the East Timorese resistance leader arrested in Dili on 20 November, is reported to be military custody in Bali. At least 12 others arrested around the same time, including relatives and friends, are believed to remain in incommunicado detention in Dili. The authorities have provided conflicting accounts of Xanana's whereabouts but unofficial sources indicate that he is held incommunicado at the Wisma Bayung, the eastern Indonesia headquarters of the Armed Forces Strategic Intelligence Agency. He is apparently to be tried under Indonesian Law but as yet no details of the charges have been made public. The other 12 detainees have reportedly been questioned intensively but no charges appear to have been brought. "
