 Up to 170 former police employees have been arrested since November 1994 and at least 133 remain in detention for investigation, on charges of ""endangering Yugoslavia's territorial integrity"". On 16 December 1994, lawyers acting for some of the accused alleged at a press conference that their clients continued to be tortured in detention. On 12 January 1995, a lawyer complained that, even after the detainees had been examined by the investigating judge, they continued to be questioned by state security police. Lawyers were not allowed to be present at these interrogations."
