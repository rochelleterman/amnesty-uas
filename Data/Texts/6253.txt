 Guatemala: Fear for Safety: Relatives and witnesses in the trial of Juan Chanay Pablo | Amnesty International 
 Twelve former members of a civil defence patrol           imprisoned for the 1993 extrajudicial execution of        villager Juan Chanay Pablo were freed from jail after the jail was attacked by a large group of their supporters.   The escaped men are said to have fled to Mexico. Amnesty  International is concerned that relatives of Juan Chanay  Pablo and witnesses to his murder may now be at risk.
