 UA 112/93 - Brazil: fear for safety: Reinaldo Cabral | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the physical safety of Reinaldo Cabral, a journalist in Maceio, Alagoas State. Following the killing of local councillor Renildo Jose dos Santos on 14 March 1993 (see UA 78/93, AMR 19/07/93, 22 March 1993), Reinaldo Cabral, the correspondent in Alagoas for the Rio de Janeiro newspaper Jornal do Brasil, published an article denouncing police violence in the state and accusing the state Military Police of being responsible for most of the 600 homicides recorded in Alagoas over the previous two years. In a radio interview that followed the publication of the report the commander of the state military police verbally attacked Reinaldo Cabral, saying that he was slandering Alagoas, and that he would like to see him outside the state boundaries.
