 The four gendarmes named above have been sentenced to death, having been found guilty of murder by the Permanent Military Court of the Central African Republic. Apart from a review by the Supreme Court, which may grant a retrial, there is no right of appeal against the verdict of a military court. AI is calling on the President to commute the death sentences."
