 Thailand: Fear of imminent execution: At least 36 people on death row | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is gravely concerned that at least  36 people face imminent execution having exhausted all    appeals against their death sentences. These fears are    heightened by the execution of five men on 8 October      1999, bringing the number of executions so far this year  to 13.  This represents an alarming acceleration since    the resumption of executions in January 1996.
