 Mexico: Fear for safety: Erica Serrano FarÃ­as (f), lawyer representing environmentalist network ROGAZ, and her family
 | Amnesty International 
 A hand-grenade was left outside a restaurant run by the family of lawyer Erica Serrano Farças on 23 February, in an apparent attempt to intimidate her because of her work representing a network of environmentalist groups campaigning against the construction of a tourist development in the municipality of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero State. The police appear reluctant to investigate properly, and Amnesty International believes that Erica Serrano Farças and her family are in danger.
