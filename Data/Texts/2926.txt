 Two named men, each of whom is the omda (mayor) of his village, were reportedly arrested in North Darfur state on 9 May after a meeting called by the International Committee of the Red Cross, where they had given information on burnt villages, killings and mass graves in a region where many villages have been destroyed and villagers killed in attacks by government aircraft and, particularly, by government-supported militias. The two have no access to lawyers or their families, and are at risk of torture or other ill-treatment.
