"Germany: Forcible Return / Risk of Torture 
 Germany: Forcible Return / Risk of Torture | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is very concerned that the German   authorities may forcibly return the two Egyptian          asylum-seekers, ?Abd al-Akher Hammad and Muhi al-Din      Ahmad ?Abd al-Mun'im, and their families, possibly as     early as today. Amnesty International believes that if    returned to Egypt, they, and possibly members of their    families, would be at grave risk of torture, unfair trial and other serious human rights violations.
