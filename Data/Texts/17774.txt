 Israel/Occupied Territories: Further information on House Demolition / forced eviction 
 | Amnesty International 
 Since the Israeli army's threat to demolish their homes, most of the people living in the village of Hadidiya have moved their tents and shacks a few hundred metres to the hamlet of Humsa. However, on 29 May Israeli forces delivered a written warning to the villagers in Humsa, ordering them to leave the area. They now fear that army bulldozers may return at any time to destroy their homes.
