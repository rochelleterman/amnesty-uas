 UA 70/94 - Mexico: harassment of human rights activists: Church human rights activists and medical personnel | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 20 February 1994 workers of the San Carlos Hospital of Altamirano, state of Chiapas, were verbally and physically harassed by a mob, allegedly instigated by local landowners and municipal authorities. It seems the reason for this harassment was the hospital workers' non-partisan involvement in the treatment of people injured during the armed conflict in Chiapas. The San Carlos Hospital is run by the religious Order of the Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. There is also concern at reports of continuing harassment by army personnel of members of the Church and other human rights activists working among the indigenous populations of Chiapas."
