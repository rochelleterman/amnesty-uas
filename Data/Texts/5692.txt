 Ecuador: Death Threats / Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of members of a local human rights organization, Fundaci—n Pachamama (Pachamama Foundation), who have received a series of death threats and intimidatory messages. The threats are believed to be linked to the organization's long-standing support of an indigenous community which opposes plans by a foreign oil company to drill for oil in their territory.
