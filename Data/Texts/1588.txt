 There is concern that members of Nigeria's security forces opened fire, in two incidents, on apparently peaceful demonstrators in the Ogoni area, 50 kilometres southeast of Port Harcourt in Rivers State, on 30 April and 4 May 1993. In the first incident at Biara, Karalolo Korgbara, a mother of five children, was shot in the chest, and ten others were seriously wounded, when farmers belonging to the Ogoni community protested against the destruction of their fields and crops by workers at an American company, Wilbros, contracted to lay pipelines for the Shell (Nigeria) oil company and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). In a second incident at Nonwa, one man, Agbarator Otu, was killed and six others were detained, one of whom is still being held at Bori military camp. "
