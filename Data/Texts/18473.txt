 Syria: Further information on health concern / legal concern: Abd al-Majid Nimer Zaghmout | Amnesty International 
 ?Abd al-Majid Nimer Zaghmout died of cancer in a military hospital on 15 February 2000, after more than 33 years'   imprisonment. Amnesty International had repeatedly called on the Syrian authorities to release him. The             organisation considers his continued detention, despite a ministerial ruling ordering his release and while he was  known to be terminally ill, to amount to cruel and        inhuman treatment.
