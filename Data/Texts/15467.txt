 UK: Impunity/Legal concern: Augusto Pinochet | Amnesty International 
 On 11 January 2000 the UK Home Secretary, Jack Straw,     announced that after considering the report on a 5        January medical examination of Augusto Pinochet he has    decided not to proceed with the extradition. Home Office  invitations for representations from interested parties   (including AI) have been made without giving the parties  the relevant medical evidence, making the whole process   unfair.
