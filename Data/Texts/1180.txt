 Koigi wa Wamwere (47) human rights activist, former political prisoner, former member of parliament, journalist; Charles Kuria Wamwere, former political prisoner; GG Njuguna Ngengi, councillor for Molo, farmer: On 13 December 1996 Koigi wa Wamwere was released on bail on health grounds. He is due to travel to the United Kingdom shortly for urgent treatment for his heart complaint. There remains concern for prisoners of conscience GG Njuguna Ngengi who has non-insulin dependant diabetes, and Charles Kuria Wamwere who has a stomach problem. Their poor diets mean that these complaints are exacerbated.
