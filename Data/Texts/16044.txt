 UA 101/93 - Kyrgyzstan: Death penalty: Grigory Abramov | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Grigory Abramov was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for threatening the life of a police officer. On appeal for reduction the sentence was increased to death. It is alleged that the Kyrgyz nationality of the victim and Abramov's Russian nationality may have influenced the outcome of the appeal. It appears that the appeal for clemency may have been turned down and that the execution may be imminent. "
