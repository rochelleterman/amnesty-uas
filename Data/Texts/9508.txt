 Larry Lonchar, scheduled to be executed on 23 June 1995, was granted a stay of execution one hour before the execution was due to take place. The stay has been granted in response to an appeal by his attorneys which claims that his organs would be unusable if he is electrocuted. Larry Lonchar has stated that he wants to donate his organs after death. He has reportedly said that he will drop his petition for a stay if the Georgia death penalty law is changed to allow another method of execution."
