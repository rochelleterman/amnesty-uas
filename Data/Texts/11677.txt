 At least 10 people have been arrested following disturbances, sometimes violent, in East Timor during the past three weeks. Another five East Timorese youths may face arrest in relation to these incidents. AI recognizes the right of the authorities to bring to justice those responsible for acts of violence. However, AI fears that those detained ma be ill-treated or tortured in incommunicado detention, and that the violence may be used as a pretext to arrest and imprison non-violent pro-independence activists."
