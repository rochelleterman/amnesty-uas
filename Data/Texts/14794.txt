 There is concern for the safety of the 13 people named above who were detained in Diyarbakir in July 1994. They have since been held in unacknowledged detention at an undisclosed location. Abdul G Gunduz, who resides in the US, but had returned on 19 June to visit his mother, was arrested by police on 6 July. The police have subsequently denied his detention. According to eye-witnesses the other 12 people were taken from their homes in the Baglar district of Diyarbakir on 8 July by plainclothes police officers. They were among a large number of people detained in Diyarbakir around the anniversary of the murder of Vedat Aydin, a local Kurdish politician who was abducted and later found tortured and killed in 1991."
