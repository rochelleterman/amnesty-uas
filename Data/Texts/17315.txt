 Hamid Sa'edi, a teacher, singer and poet from Iran's Kurdish minority, was reportedly arrested on 22 April by plain clothed officials of the Ministry of Intelligence, in the city of Sanandaj, in Kordestan province, northwestern Iran. He was reportedly summoned by officials to a court, possibly for questioning, where he was arrested. He is currently held incommunicado in a Ministry of Intelligence detention facility in Sanandaj.  Amnesty International is concerned that he may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment.
