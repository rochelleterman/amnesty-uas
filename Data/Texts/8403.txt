 Trinidad and Tobago:  Death Penalty/Legal Concern | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that Peter Cadette was charged on 17 March, with a crime that carries a mandatory death sentence without having being provided with legal representation. As a result of his lack of legal representation, there are fears that Peter Cadette could be at risk of ill- treatment in detention.
