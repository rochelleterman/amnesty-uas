 On 2 May 1994 the above men were abducted from their homes in San Vicente del Congo, Turbo municipality, Uraba region, Antioquia department, by a group of between 50 and 60 heavily armed men. They have not been seen since and there is serious concern for their safety. Their abductors, who wore a mixture of military and civilian dress, identified themselves as members of a paramilitary ""self-defence"" group. They reportedly had a list of names."
