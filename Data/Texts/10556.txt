 Myanmar: Further information on health concern / prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 U Cho Aung Than, Dr Aung Khin Sint and U Win Tin: On 10 October 1997 the State law and Order restoration Council (SLORC) responded to queries made by journalists about the health of the above-named individuals. They all have been admitted to hospital for medical treatment. The SLORC stated that their medical condition was not critical and that they had been moved to hospital because prison authorities believed that their health would improve more rapidly with additional medical treatment. Amnesty International continues to appeal for the immediate and unconditional release of these individuals.
