 On 27 July 1993, village guards and security forces reportedly set fire to houses in Kelekci, Gunesli and Kayikli near Dargecit in Mardin province. This was reportedly done in retaliation for the villagers' refusal to take up arms as village guards. On 30 August, village guards from neighbouring Altinoluk came again to these villages, with a team of gendarmerie, and after gathering the inhabitants together, told them to leave. If they refused, the village guards threatened to destroy all houses and kill those found still living there. They then took away the five people named above, as well as two others, from Kelekci, whom they later released. The men are being held unlawfully in Altinoluk, and are reportedly being subjected to torture. "
