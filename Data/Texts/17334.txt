 Iran: Incommunicado detention / fear of torture or ill-treatment / prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International fears that trade unionists Heis Amani and Sedigh Karimi may be held incommunicado at an unknown location and are possibly at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Amnesty International believes that the two men are prisoners of conscience, held solely for the peaceful expression of their conscientiously held beliefs, and calls for their immediate release.
