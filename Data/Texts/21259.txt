 NA 
 The lawyer and family of popular Vietnamese blogger Nguyen Hoang Hai, also known as Dieu Cay, have not been allowed to visit him in prison for six months. There are concerns for his health, as they have also been prevented from sending him food and medicine. Despite completing a 30-month prison sentence in October 2010, he was detained for further investigation on charges of “conducting propaganda” against the state. "
