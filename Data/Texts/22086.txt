 NA 
 Womenâ€™s rights activist Maryam Bahreman was arrested on 11 May 2011 by security officials, believed to be from the Ministry of Intelligence, who searched her home for three hours and then took her away as well as some of her personal possessions.  She is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment.  Amnesty International considers her to be a prisoner of conscience, held solely for the peaceful exercise of her rights to freedom of expression and association."
