 NA 
 Fan Qihang, a Chinese man, is at risk of execution if the Supreme People's Court upholds his death sentence. He says his conviction is based on a confession extracted through torture. 
Fan Qihang was detained on 26 June 2009 amidst a local campaign to strike hard on organized crime. He says that he was repeatedly tortured in an unofficial place of detention and forced to confess to crimes he did not commit."
