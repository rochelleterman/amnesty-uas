 Bangladesh : Further Information on possible prisoners of conscience/Fear of torture/Incommunicado detention | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned for the safety of some 14 opposition politicians and two journalists held incommunicado since 8 December. They were all arrested without a warrant, and are at risk of torture. Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Mukul Bose politicians, and journalists Sheikh Bazlur Rahman, Tofael Ahmed, Muntasir Mamun Saber Hossain Chowdhury was released on 12 January 2003 after the High Court declared his detention illegal. There are fears that he may be at risk of re-arrest in connection with further politically motivated charges. Sheikh Bazlur Rahman was released on the same day.
