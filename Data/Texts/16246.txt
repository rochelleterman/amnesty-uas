 Uzbekistan: Fear of imminent execution / torture concern / legal concern | Amnesty International 
 Rafis Valeyev, aged 27, Vitaly An, Atan Abdulayev, Ayubkhon Akbarov: AI fears that the above face imminent execution after having been sentenced to death in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan. Atan Abdulayev and Ayubkhon Akbarov are known to have had appeals against their sentences turned down by the Supreme Court, and this is feared to be the case of the two other prisoners. Their only hope of avoiding execution now is a petition for clemency to the President of Uzbekistan. AI is also concerned about allegations that Rafis Valeyev was tortured in detention and that the legal proceedings against Atan Abdulayev were flawed.
