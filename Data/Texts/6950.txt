 AI is concerned for the safety of the six Haitians named in this action, who were reportedly arrested in Port-au-Prince on 14 December 1993. They were among some 111 people reportedly forcibly returned to Haiti by the USA Coast Guard. AI understands that some of the remaining refugees have interview dates with the International Organization for Migration but has no further details."
