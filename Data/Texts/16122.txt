 Turkmenistan:          Possible prisoner of conscience/ Fear for safety: Gurbandurdy Durdykuliev
 | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the safety of Gurbandurdy Durdykuliev, a critic of the Turkmen government, following his reported forcible confinement in a psychiatric hospital. It is feared he may have been confined solely for the non-violent expression of his political views. If this is the case, Amnesty International would consider him a prisoner of conscience.
