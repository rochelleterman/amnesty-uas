 Khalid al-Zahrani's sentence of 600 lashes and eight months' imprisonment was recently upheld by a Court of Cassation in Saudi Arabia. He is not in custody, but could be imprisoned and flogged at any time. No further information is known about the unnamed female student who was sentenced in the same case, but it is believed that she too is at imminent risk of flogging and imprisonment."
