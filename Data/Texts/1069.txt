 AI is concerned about the health of the prisoners of conscience named above, particularly that of Dr Lawali Oyondi, Njenga Mungai and Joel Odoyo Ondiala, currently in Nakuru provincial hospital with chronic diarrhoea. The other three men are also reportedly unwell. There has been an outbreak of diarrhoea at Nakuru Prison. Many prisoners are reported to be ill. Conditions at the prison are reported to be harsh, with severe overcrowding, lack of fresh water and inadequate nutrition. AI is calling for these prisoners of conscience to receive appropriate medical treatment. AI continues to call for their release."
