 Colombia: Fear for safety/possible ""disappearances"" | Amnesty International 
 Army-backed paramilitaries reportedly raided an indigenous community in the department of La Guajira on 18 April 2004 and killed at least eight people. They also abducted an 11-year-old child, the woman and child named above, and several other people, whose whereabouts are now unknown. Amnesty International is seriously concerned that unless the authorities take action immediately, paramilitaries will kill more people in the region, and the lives of those abducted will be in grave danger. Reports received today by Amnesty International indicate that inhabitants of the indigenous community, currently displaced, have recently been threatened by paramilitaries.
