 Zimbabwe: Fear for safety/ Ill-treatment/ health concern | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is gravely concerned by credible reports that members of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), including those named above, have been beaten at Matapi Police Station in the capital, Harare. They were transferred to Harare Central Police Station on 14 September. Hundreds of members of the ZCTU and women's organization Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) are also reported to be detained in Harare and other urban centres in Zimbabwe. Members of ZCTU and WOZA are being held in a number of police stations, without access to lawyers, adequate food and medical care. Five babies are thought to be detained along with their mothers, who are WOZA members. There are serious concerns for the health and safety of all those held.
