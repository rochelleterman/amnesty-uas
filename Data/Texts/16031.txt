 EXTRA 27/94 - Kazakhstan: fear of imminent execution: four soldiers (names not known to AI) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Four soldiers were reportedly sentenced to death for murder on or shortly before 19 April 1994. They do not have the right to appeal against their death sentences. They may petition the president for clemency but to AI's knowledge, the carrying out of a death sentence is not automatically suspended while such petitions are being considered."
