 In separate incidents over recent days, some 30 individuals are reported to have been detained by the authorities and there are fears that they may be at risk of torture. On 4 December former East Timorese political prisoner Martinho Pereira was arrested by military personnel in Surabaya, East Java, while on his way to Jakarta. His exact whereabouts are unknown and his family have not been allowed to visit him. Twelve other East Timorese are also reported to have been arrested in connection with the visit to East Timor by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. There is also concern for the safety of about 20 individuals arrested as they were protesting outside the French and Thai Embassies in Jakarta."
