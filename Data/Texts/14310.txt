 The nine people named above from the village of Yesilyurt in southeast Turkey were detained on 17 February 1993, after security forces had surrounded and searched the village, claiming to have found weapons. Kamil and Bahattin Mustak are the principal plaintiffs in a prosecution brought 4 years ago against a gendarmerie officer who allegedly forced Bahattin Mustak to smear his father's mouth with human excrement. It is believed that the police operation of 17 February may bave been organized to discredit the plaintiffs, whom AI fears are at risk of torture."
