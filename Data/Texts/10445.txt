 AI has learned the names of four more young activists who were among some 50 arrested on 20 February 1995. Two of them, Tin Than Oo and Aung Zeya, have been detained previously. It is not clear whether Aw Wai and Maung Nyunt have been detained previously. AI fears for the safety of all these young activists in detention."
