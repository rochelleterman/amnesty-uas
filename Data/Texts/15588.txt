 Russian Federation: Fear for safety/Torture and ill-treatment: People of Roma ethnicity in St Petersburg and Pskov regions | Amnesty International 
 In May 2004 police launched an operation targeting Roma in St Petersburg leading to violations of Roma human rights. In addition, threats of skinhead attacks in Pskov region in north-western Russia have forced Roma to leave their homes due to alleged police failure to protect them. Amnesty International is concerned that Roma people in the area are in serious danger.
