 Belarus: Death penalty: Ihar Mironaw | Amnesty International 
 On 23 January 1998, Ihar Mironaw was sentenced to death by the Vitebsk Regional Court.  He is thought to be appealing to the Supreme Court of Belarus.  If the Supreme Court refuses to uphold his appeal against his death sentence, his only chance will be to appeal to President Lukashenka to grant clemency.
