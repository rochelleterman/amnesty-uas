 The four detainees named above are reported to be in very poor health as a result of torture. They were arrested around 3 December 1992 in Igdir province. When brought before the Public Prosecutor they reportedly showed him the injuries they had sustained during interrogation, whereupon soldiers present at the hearing attacked and beat them. They are currently in Igdir Prison, on charges of supporting the PKK. The authorities appear to have taken no action on their torture allegations. It is feared that the detainees are not receiving the medical treatment they require. "
