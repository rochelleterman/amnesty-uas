 At least 80 prisoners in Diyarbakir E-type Prison (for political prisoners) have been wounded, some severely, after police and soldiers entered the prison on 4 October 1994. One prisoner, 19-year-old Ramazan Ozuak, died. The police and soldiers entered the prison apparently to move some of the prisoners. When prisoners blocked the entrances to Wards 18, 27 and 31, they reportedly blew the ceilings and walls apart and fired in tear gas. The prisoners were then allegedly beaten until the morning of 5 October."
