 After 35 days held incommunicado, male Iranian prisoner of conscience Abdollah Momeni appeared in court in Tehran with five others on 14 September 2009. He is accused among other things of propaganda among the system. The evidence produced against him included “contacts with [the] human rights NGOs Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch”. He “confessed” and requested a pardon. Amnesty International fears his statements were made under duress."
