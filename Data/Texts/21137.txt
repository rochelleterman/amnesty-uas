 All legal appeals have been exhausted for Timhar and Nurrie Ong, a Filipino couple facing the death penalty in Malaysia. The couple were found guilty in November 2006 of trafficking dangerous drugs and sentenced to life imprisonment. In 2007 the prosecution successfully appealed against their sentence and the high court sentenced them to death by hanging that year.  "
