 NA 
 Peruvian trade union leaders Pedro Condori Laurente and Antonio Quispe Tamayo were released on 29 March 2011, pending the outcome of the trial. They had both been detained since 11 January 2011 on unfounded charges. No evidence that they have committed any crime has been presented and Amnesty International believes they are being charged solely because of their peaceful human rights work."
