 AI is concerned about the recent arrest of human rights lawyer, Munir, in Malang, East Java. AI believes that he may have been arrested to prevent him from representing his clients in lawfully challenging their employer's actions and to intimidate others from undertaking similar work. Munir is a lawyer at the Surabaya office of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute (LBH). He was arrested about 11pm on 19 August 1994 and interrogated for approximately two hours at a local police station before being released."
