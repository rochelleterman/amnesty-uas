 Algeria: Stop destroying evidence | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Amnesty International is concerned about shocking reports of attempts in Algeria to conceal or destroy evidence of  human rights abuses.  According to these reports, human   remains were secretly exhumed in January this year from a mass grave site in the western province of Relizane. The  site had been discovered in November 2003 by a local      human rights activist who also collected evidence         indicating that it contained the remains of civilians     abducted and killed by local state-armed militias."
