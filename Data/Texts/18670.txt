 Syria: Further information on fear of torture/incommunicado detention/Prisoners of conscience and new concern: Unfair trial | Amnesty International 
 Ten 10 civil society activists (Anwar al-Bunni (m), Nidal Darwish (m), Michel Kilo (m), Khalil Hussein (m), Mahmoud Mer'i (m), Dr Safwan Tayfour (m), Mahmoud 'Issa (m), Ghaleb 'Amer (m), Suleyman Shummar (m), Muhammad Mahfouz (m)) are reportedly facing charges which could see them jailed for up to 15 years. The charges appear to be entirely without foundation, and their trial is likely to be grossly unfair. All were reportedly beaten during interrogation. Their lawyers went to 'Adra prison to meet with them on 28 May, but were not allowed to see them.
