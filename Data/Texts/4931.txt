 Lacides Bandera Ariza is reported to have ""disappeared"" after being arbitrarily detained by soldiers of the Magangue Battalion. He was arrested at the home of Victor Miranda Guarin and Delfina Diaz in Puerto Rico, Municipality of Pinillos, department of Bolivar. Three witnesses to the detention who went to make inquiries at the military base recognized a corporal there, but he denied all knowledge of the incident and threatened Elias Maria, a member of the community."
