 UA 372/94 - South Africa: fear of extrajudicial execution: Prince Sifiso Zulu | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned for the safety of Prince Sifiso Zulu, a member of the Zulu Royal House, who is named in an anonymous and threatening pamphlet circulating in Northern Natal. He has been in hiding since early 1994. There have been at least three attempts on his life this year. The threats have occurred in the context of a rift between Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and King Goodwill Zwelithini, during which Prince Sifiso gained prominence as a spokesperson for the Royal House Interim Committee."
