 Brazil: Further information on fear for safety/ forced eviction: About 500 members of the Patax√≥ H√£h√£h√£e indigenous community

 | Amnesty International 
 Members of the Patax¢ H®h®h®e indigenous community are no longer in danger of forced eviction as they voluntarily left the seven farms they were occupying in the Alegrias region, Itaju do ColÒnia municipality, in Bahia state in mid-April. They had been occupying the farms since January 2006 in protest against the inaction of the Supreme Federal Court, which has been deliberating on the status of the lands since 1982.
