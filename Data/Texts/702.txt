 Over 360 families are at risk of being forcibly evicted from their homes in several neighbourhoods in Malabo, the capital, and many may be left homeless during the rainy season. The families have been given 15 days to vacate their homes before they are demolished between 15 and 30 November 2006. Amnesty International fears that police and military personnel may use excessive force to evict these families.
