 On 22 June 1995, the three priests named above were reportedly arrested without warrant, by members of the Republic Attorney General's Office. Their whereabouts are not known at present. Concern for their safety has been heightened by reports that two of them have received death threats in the past, apparently for advocacy of human rights for the local indigenous population."
