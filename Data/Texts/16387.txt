 Macedonia:  Fear of arrest as a prisoner of conscience
 | Amnesty International 
 The Macedonian authorities have reportedly threatened to arrest Mirjana Najcevska (f), the President of the Macedonian Helsinki Committee (a branch of a European federation of human rights organisations), after the Committee published a report criticising the human rights situation in the country. She is now in France, but she intends to return to Macedonia shortly. If she is arrested Amnesty International will consider her a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for her work in defence of human rights.
