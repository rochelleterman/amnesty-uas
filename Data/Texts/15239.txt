 AI has learnt of the detention of another person, Kalender Maden, aged 35 and married with five children. He and the others named above are being held in unacknowledged incommunicado detention and AI fears that they are being interrogated under torture. Kalender Maden was detained by plainclothes police officers on 6 November 1992 and is thought to be held in Istanbul Police Headquarters. He was active in a local association, Malle Guzellestirme ve Gelistirme Dernegi, which aims to improve the environment of the neighbourhood. As with the other cases, the police have so far denied that they are holding Kalender Maden. "
