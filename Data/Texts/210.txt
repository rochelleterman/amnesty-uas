 Burundi: Fear of execution | Amnesty International 
 The four Rwandese men Simon Munyakazi, Apollinaire Mwiseneza, James Gakuru and Francis Maheshi were tried on charges which carry the death penalty, on 23 February. Amnesty International believes their trial was unfair. They were denied legal assistance, and had no time to prepare a proper defence. The verdict is expected to be announced shortly. Amnesty International is concerned at reports that, if convicted and sentenced to death, the men's right to appeal may be undermined and they may be executed shortly afterwards.
