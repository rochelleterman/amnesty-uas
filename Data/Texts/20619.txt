 USA: Further information: 13-year-old boy to be tried in juvenile court | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 23 August, a Pennsylvania trial court ordered the immediate transfer of Jordan Brownâ€™s case to a juvenile court for trial. This decision removes the risk of 13-year-old Jordan Brown being sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Such a sentence, when imposed on anyone under 18 years old at the time of the crime, violates international law."
