 NA 
 There is concern for the health of prisoner of conscience Luis Alberto Pita Santos, who is held in the Camaguey Special High Security Prison, known as ""Kilo 8"". He had declared himself ""plantado"", a form of protest in which political prisoners refuse to wear the common prison uniform, and had undertaken several hunger strikes. He is said to be extremely thin, and is said to have told his wife that he had been subjected to pressure, including beatings, from prison officials to give up his protest. He is said to have been chained for long periods to the bars of his cell, and to have been denied medical treatment."
