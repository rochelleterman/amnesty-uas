 NA 
 On 17 August 1995 Father David Fernandez received a threatening phone call while meeting with other members of the Jesuit order at his home in Mexico city. The threats follow the publication on 14 August 1995 of remarks made by Father Fernandez in the weekly magazine Proceso, where he criticized the role of the security forces in recent violent incidents in the states of Chiapas and Guerrero. Father Fernandez is head of the Jesuit order' human rights organization, Centro de Derechos Humanos Agustin Pro-Juarez (PRODH), which has reportedly been under surveillance by the Investigation and National Security Centre (CISEN)."
