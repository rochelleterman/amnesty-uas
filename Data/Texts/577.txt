 AI is gravely concerned that the continuing fighting in Brazzaville has resulted in at least 95 political killings since December 1993. Many of those killed were reportedly extrajudicially executed by government forces and supporters of President Pascal Lissouba. Armed opponents of the government are also responsible for many killings. Those murdered include opposition supporter Clement Massengo and his wife and daughter, Colonel Jean-Pierre Mouanda and his wife and Laurent Bisset. President Lissouba has opened negotiations with the opposition in an attempt to end the violence."
