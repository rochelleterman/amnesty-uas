 A senior police officer has attacked Brother Henri de     Rosiers in the press, after the church mission he works   for published a report denouncing police torture of       prisoners. This attack may put him and other mission      staff such as Anilson Russi, Ana de Sousa Pinto and       Airton dos Reis Perreira at greater risk from death       squads.
