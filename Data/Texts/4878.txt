 UA 199/94 - Colombia: fear for safety / possible extrajudicial execution: Teofila Roa, Yesid Bocanegra Martinez, Omar Mendoza | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 15 May 1994 three armed men opened fire on two indigenous leaders, killing Yesid Bocanegra and seriously injuring Omar Mendoza. Yesid Bocanegra had worked for eight years for the Consejo Regional Indigena de Tolima (CRIT), Indigenous Council of Tolima. Omar Mendoza is the Vice-President of the CRIT. There is now serious concern for the President of the CRIT, Teofila Roa and her family. The security forces have failed to investigate previous threats against and killings of CRIT leaders and the indigenous population in Tolima."
