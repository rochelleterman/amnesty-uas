 The Laranjeira Ã‘anderu indigenous community, including over 80 children and 30 elderly people, is at risk of eviction from an area they claim as ancestral lands in Brazil. If evicted, the community will be forced to live on a small plot of land near a highway, without adequate access to water, shade or area to plant crops."
