 On 17 April,  five members of Me’ phaa Indigenous People’s Organization (OPIM) were detained and charged with the murder of Alejandro Feliciano García on 1 January 2008 in the village of El Camalote, Guerrero state. Amnesty International has adopted all five indigenous rights activists as prisoners of conscience and believes that the charges against them are politically motivated."
