 Myanmar: Fear of torture/prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Two leaders of the opposition National League for  Democracy (NLD) have reportedly been imprisoned, together with 16 members of the party's Youth wing, after they     tried to attend a party meeting. Political    prisoners   are routinely tortured in Myanmar.   Amnesty              International would consider them      prisoners of       conscience, arrested solely for exercising   their right  to freedom of association and   membership of a           non-violent political party.
