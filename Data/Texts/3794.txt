 Katithaurlu Indians, Ariovaldo Jose dos Santos, FUNAI field worker, Sebastiao Moreira, CIMI Coordinator, Mato Grosso: Amnesty International remains concerned for the safety of Nambikwara Indians in the Sarare area. Although an operation is underway by Federal Police and other goverment agencies to remove illegal miners and loggers who have invaded the Sarare indigenous reserve, indigenous agencies are concerned that when the Federal Police have left the area, the miners and loggers will simply return, and that without specific measures to protect their safety, the Nambikwara Indians will again be at risk from attacks.
