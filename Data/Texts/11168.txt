 Sheikh Mohammad Ashraf, President of the Baramulla Branch of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association, has reportedly not been seen since his arrest on the night of 15/16 June 1995. There are grave fears for his safety. He was reportedly arrested by members of the Army Rashtriya Rifles. The army has now acknowledged his detention but has not revealed his whereabouts or allowed relatives to see him. His home was raided by security forces on 20 June. The Jammu and Kashmir Bar Association has documented human rights violations in Kashmir over the past four years and has filed petitions to the courts to have them investigated."
