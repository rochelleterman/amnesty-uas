 Venezuela: Fear for safety: members of the Human Rights Office of the Apostolic Vicariate | Amnesty International 
 Recent attacks and threats against members of the Oficina de Derechos Humanos Vicariato Apostolico, of Puerto Ayacucho, state of Amazonas, have raised serious fears for their safety. On 27 May two vehicles, one belonging to the Human Rights Office, the other to a nun, were damaged by acid bombs. On 7 June another member was reportedly insulted and threatened in the street. Members of the Human Rights Office believe they are being targeted for their work with indigenous communities in the area.
