 Uzbekistan: Fear of imminent execution/torture/death in custody | Amnesty International 
 Oybek Ruzmetov, Uygun Ruzmetov,Sardor Allayarov and Utkir Yusupov face imminent execution, after the Supreme Court  rejected appeals against their death sentences. At least  two of them allegedly confessed under torture, and        Shikhnozor Yakubov has died in prison, reportedly beaten  to death. Their only hope now is clemency from President  Islam Karimov.
