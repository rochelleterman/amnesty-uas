 Mexico: Fear for safety: Victor Manuel Quintana Silveyra | Amnesty International 
 There is concern for the safety of Victor Manuel Quintana Silveyra, a human rights defender and a congressional deputy for the state of Chihuahua, and for members of his family. On 18 June 1997 he was abducted in Mexico City by four unidentified men who detained him for eight hours, and who beat him and threatened him and his family. It is believed he has been targeted because of his political activities and his work in defence of human rights.
