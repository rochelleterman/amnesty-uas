 There is concern for the safety of the above named civil servants amid reports that they are being severely tortured and that one of them, Andre Ndereyimana, is close to death. They were arbitrarily detained at the end of May 1994, and are currently held in Gitega prison. Although no charges have been announced against the detainees, it appears that they are suspected of involvement in the mass killings which occurred in late 1993."
