 There have been repeated reports of arbitrary arrest, threats, beatings and intimidation of protestors in the city of Oaxaca, and of those perceived as supporting demonstrations calling for the state governor's resignation. The state authorities have reportedly failed to prevent or investigate human rights abuses by the security forces and unidentified armed individuals working them. Some groups of protestors have also reportedly intimidated and threatened supporters of the state governor and public officials.
