 Bayram Bal and Hamit Bal, Kurdish villagers, were found dead near Yandere village in the Nusaybin district of Mardin province on 20 December 1994. Reports indicate that they had been tortured and then killed by shots to the head. They are among more than 400 people who became victims of political killings in Turkey in 1994. Most were killed in the southeast, where government forces are engaged in a violent conflict with the guerrillas of the PKK."
