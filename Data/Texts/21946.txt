 Iran: Further information on arbitrary arrest/unfair trial/ prisoners of conscience  | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Doctors Arash and Kamiar Alaei learned on 19 January that they had been sentenced to six and three years' imprisonment respectively, for âcooperating with an enemy governmentâ. Amnesty International considers them prisoners of conscience, as they appear to have been imprisoned solely in relation to their work with international and specifically US institutions in the field of HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment."
