 Amnesty International is extremely concerned that         Pakistan's Ahmadiyya religious minority are at risk of    violent attack, after 10 Ahmadis were unlawfully killed   in Punjab province during the past two weeks.

Gunmen shot dead five members of the Ahmadiyya community  , as they left their mosque after early   morning prayers .     Among the dead was a 16-year-old boy.    No one is  known to have been arrested in        connection with the attack."
