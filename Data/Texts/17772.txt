 Israel/Occupied Territories: Fear of deportation: Walid Hanatche (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Walid Hanatche, a Palestinian who has been detained without charge or trial since May 2002, has been put under pressure by the Israeli authorities to accept deportation to an unspecified country or face the possibility of remaining in administrative detention indefinitely. Amnesty International is concerned that the Israeli authorities intend to use this as a test case, and that if they succeed in deporting Walid Hanatche they may deport more Palestinians.
