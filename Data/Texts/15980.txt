 The above-named men face imminent execution after being sentenced to death without right of appeal on 12 May 1993 in the former Soviet republic of Azerbaydzhan. According to press reports, the five men, privates in the Russian Seventh Army deployed in Armenia, were arrested in neighbouring Azerbaydzhan in September 1992, accused of taking part in fighting in the disputed Karabakh region in June 1992. Amnesty International is appealing to President Elchibey to commute these and all other pending death sentences. "
