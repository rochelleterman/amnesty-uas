"Israel and the Occupied Territories: Fear for safety 
 Israel and the Occupied Territories: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 After an attack on a bus and suicide bombings killed 10 Israelis on 12 December, Israel today broke off diplomatic links with the Palestinian Authority and bombed Gaza, Ramallah and Nablus. With this escalation in the violence already endemic in Israel and the Occupied Territories, many more civilians will be killed or injured unless Israel, the Palestinian Authority and all armed groups recognize the fundamental importance of the right to life and physical integrity.
