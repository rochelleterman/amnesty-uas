 There have been further reports of attacks in May 1995 on Roman Catholic churches and officials and new expulsions of Muslims in the area of northwest Bosnia under the control of the Bosnian Serb de facto authorities. In one such incident on 12 May the Roman Catholic church in the village of Presnace was blown up, and a nun, Cecilija Grgic, and the parish priest, Father Filip Lukenda, were reportedly burned in the resulting fire. On 13 May around 190 Muslims were forcibly expelled from Travnik; thirty or forty men of military age were removed from the group and it is feared thay may be used to perform forced labour."
