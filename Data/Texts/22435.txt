 Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories: Fear for safety: Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Israeli Defence Force killed more than 100 Palestinians during a five-day incursion into the Gaza Strip, which ended on 3 March 2008. Many of those killed were Palestinian militants involved in attacks on Israel but at least half of those killed are reported to have been unarmed civilians taking no part in the fighting, including at least 25 children. Amnesty International fears that there may be more attacks using reckless and disproportionate force leading to deaths of civilian bystanders."
