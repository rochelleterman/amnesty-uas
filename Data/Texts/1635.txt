 Nigeria: Executions / fear of further executions: 43 prisoners convicted of armed robbery (names not known) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 22nd July 1995, 43 prisoners were executed by firing squad before a crowd of 1000 people in Lagos, Nigeria. They had been convicted of armed robbery by Robbery and Firearms Tribunals, special courts outside the normal judicial system which cannot guarantee fair trial and which allow no right of appeal to a higher, independent jurisdiction. Another 10 people were granted stays of execution; it is not clear whether their sentences have been commuted."
