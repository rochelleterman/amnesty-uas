 Madagascar: Fear for safety/Medical concern/ Possible Prisoner of Conscience (POC) | Amnesty International 
 Possible prisoner of conscience Ali Sarety is being denied specialist medical treatment by the provincial authorities and security forces. He is a prominent supporter of Marc Ravalomanana, who was officially declared President of Madagascar on 29 April. As such there are fears for his safety, as he is at risk of being ill-treated by supporters of the outgoing President, Didier Ratsiraka.
