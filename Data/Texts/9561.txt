 Lloyd Schlup, white, is scheduled to be executed on 19 November. He was convicted in participating in the murder of Arthur Dade, a fellow inmate at the Missouri State Penitentiary. Dade, who was black, was killed by two members of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist prison gang. At Schlup's trial the only evidence against him was provided by the statements of two corrections officers, while some crucial information was not presented to the jury. "
