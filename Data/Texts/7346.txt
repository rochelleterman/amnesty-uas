 On 14 August 1995 the governmental National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) issued an extensive report on the massacre of 17 peasants on 28 June at Aguas Blancas in Guerrero State. It concluded with 15 recommendations for action against the officials responsible. AI welcomes the report and continues to press for all those responsible for the killings to be brought to justice. Although there have been no further attacks or death threats reported, there continues to be concern for the safety of members of the Organizacion Campesina de la Sierra del Sur (OCSS) and the Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD). The whereabouts of Gilberto Romero Vazquez, an OCSS activist who ""disappeared"" on 24 May 1995, remain unknown."
