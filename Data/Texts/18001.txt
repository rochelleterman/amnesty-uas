 Kuwait: Death penalty/imminent execution: Marilou Ranario (f) | Amnesty International 
 Filipina domestic worker Marilou Ranario was sentenced to death in 2005, and had her sentence confirmed by the Court of Cassation on 27 November 2007. The sentence will now go before Kuwait's head of state, the Amir, for ratification. This typically takes between two weeks and a month, after which, if the sentence is ratified, Marilou Ranario will be in imminent danger of execution.
