 Amnesty International has received information that some of those named above have been released; the rest remain in detention. There have also been reports of further arrests. Shikh Safr 'Abdul-Rahman al-Hawali was hospitalized at the beginning of November, but there are no further details on his condition. There remains concern that those still in detention may be subjected to torture and ill-treatment."
