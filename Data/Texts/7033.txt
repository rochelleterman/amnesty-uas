 AI fears for the safety of staff at Casa Alianza Honduras, a non-governmental organization in Tegucigalpa working with street children. AI has received reports that they have been threatened and intimidated. At least nine threatening phone calls were made to staff on during the morning of 5 July 1995; later that day three men, two of whom had machine guns, were reportedly seen driving around the area near their offices. The threats have been reported to the Public Ministry and the Commissioner for Human Rights."
