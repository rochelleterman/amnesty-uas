 Antoine Augustin, a teacher and associate of deposed President Aristide, was reportedly arrested on 5 December 1992 in Cap-Haitien, North Department. He was reportedly arrested without a warrant by soldiers who claimed to be acting on the orders of an officer. It is not clear what accusation has been made against him. Antoine Augustin had been in hiding since the 1991 coup which deposed President Aristide but had recently decided to return to Cap-Haitien. He is believed to be held incommunicado in Cap-Haitien Prison. "
