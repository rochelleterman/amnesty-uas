 Scores of people have been arrested since late August 1992 on national security charges. The ANSP announced on 30 September 1992 that it had uncovered the biggest espionage case since the Korean War. AI has received reports that some of those detained have been held incommunicado and tortured during interrogation by ANSP officials. Kim Nak-jung was allegedly held incommunicado for 10 days after arrest and beaten and deprived of sleep during interrogation. Chun Hee-shik (now released) also claimed to have been beaten. Hwang In-oh, his wife Song Hae-suk and their three-year- old son were held incommunicado for over a week; Song Hae-suk was reportedly threatened with sexual abuse and beaten in the presence of her child.
