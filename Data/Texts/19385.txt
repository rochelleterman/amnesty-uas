 Yemen: Further information on Incommunicado detention/Fear of torture/Medical concern | Amnesty International 
 Brigadier Nasser al-Nouba, aged in his 50s, Ahmed 'Omar   bin Farid and Ahmed al-Qama'a were arrested on 2          September 2007 after taking part in a protest by retired  soldiers in central Aden. Hassan Ba'oom, his son Fadi     Ba'oom, and Mohsin al-Yazidi were arrested on 1 September following a related protest in the city of al-Mukalla.    Nasser al-'Awlaqi, aged about 40, and 'Abbas al-'Assal,   aged 42, are thought to remain held incommunicado without charge after their arrest in August. Amnesty              International is concerned that the eight men may be      prisoners of conscience, held solely for peacefully       exercising their rights to freedom of expression and      assembly.
