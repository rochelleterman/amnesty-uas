 Army-backed paramilitaries have reportedly moved into the Alto Naya region, and ordered local people to leave, although the area is still ostensibly under the control of the army. Paramilitary contingents have reportedly arrived in four municipalities and threatened local peasant farmers and given the communities until 10 August to abandon the area. Two hundred indigenous people that were forced to flee their homes by the April massacre are planning to return to their homes on 10 and 11 August.
