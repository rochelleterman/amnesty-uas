 Dr Jose Maria Mendez, a prominent lawyer, has received two letters from individuals claiming to be members of the notorious ""death squad"", Brigada Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez. In the second letter of 25 November he was told to pressure his friend, Dr Francisco Lima, also a lawyer, to withdraw his candidature in the presidential elections. He is representing an opposition coalition composed of the Democratic Convergence (CD) and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). The second letter also contained threats against his wife and son. In it he was told to persuade his son, himself a prominent lawyer, to withdraw from a land dispute case in which he is representing the FMLN."
