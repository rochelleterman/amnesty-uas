 Francos Marcos, a Kenyan citizen, is reportedly receiving emergency hospital treatment after being crushed and seiously injured by an armoured vehicle on 4 January 1994. He is one of about 130 Africans being held as illegal immigrants at a refugee camp in Silopi, Sirnak. The poor conditions there and the lack of post-operative medical care would put his recovery and ultimately his life at risk."
