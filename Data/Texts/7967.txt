 Peru: Fear for safety: Edwin Benites Gonzales | Amnesty International 
 There are fears for the safety of former military         conscript Edwin Benites Gonzales, who has been taken into custody by the army, apparently in connection with        charges of which he had been acquitted. There are fears   that he may suffer reprisals as a result of recent        complaints that his detention is arbitrary.
