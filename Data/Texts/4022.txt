 On 22 October Sister Cecilia Petrina de Carvalho was driving with town councillor Analdino Laranjeira to the village of Cacimbas, Bahia state, when their vehicle was fired upon by a hooded man at the side of the road. She was hit by a bullet. She had been receiving death threats in the context of her work as a lawyer representing peasants involved in land disputes in the region. Lawyers acting on her behalf have been concerned by police delays in undertaking their investigation. "
