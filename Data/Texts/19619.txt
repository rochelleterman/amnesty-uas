 South Africa: Shop raids jeopardise safety of refugees | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Hundreds of asylum-seekers and refugees in South Africaâ€™s Limpopo province are being pushed into destitution because police are forcibly and without notice closing their shops and seizing their goods. Traumatised by this harassment, many victims may be coerced into returning to the countries from which they originally fled. The shop closures began from late June and have continued regularly since then across the province. Fears are growing that this coordinated campaign could spread to other provinces."
