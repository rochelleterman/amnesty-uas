 NA 
 The body of Jorge Antonio de Oliveira Filho, a 20-year-old educator of street children in Rio de Janeiro, was officially identified on 12 November 1992. The director of the organization he worked for, the Brazilian Institute for Innovations in Social Health (IBISS) identified it in the city morgue. It had apparently been brought there on 6 November, the day after he was last seen alive. The police said the body had been found alone in a car and the official autopsy stated that he had died in a car accident. Jorge Antonio had no driving licence as he could not drive. The body reportedly bore marks which looked as if they had been caused by beating. IBISS is one of several organizations working with street children which has been receiving threats since September 1992. "
