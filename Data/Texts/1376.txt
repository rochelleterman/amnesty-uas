 Unidentified assailants attacked a car carrying Chakufwa Chihana, trade union official and President of AFORD, and his lawyer, Bazuka Mhango, as they were leaving the High Court in Lilongwe on 4 November 1992. Mr Chihana is on trial for sedition, allegedly contained in speeches he made calling for the introduction of a multi-party political system in Malawi. AFORD supporters arrested on 2 November 1992 appear still to be detained without trial. AFORD has stated that the Minister of Health has announced that the government has banned the organization. "
