 Allegations that Russian forces have beaten and otherwise ill-treated people detained during the conflict in the Chechen Republic are highlighting the urgent need for the ICRC to have full access to all such detainees. Information collected by human rights groups includes reports of beatings and mock executions and of poor conditions of detention. The Russian authorities have refused to release figures on the number of people detained by their forces. The ICRC has yet to receive permission for full access to all prisoners held by Russian officials."
