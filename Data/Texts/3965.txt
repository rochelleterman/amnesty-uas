 Brazil: Further information on: fear for safety: 250 members of the Guarani-Kaiowa indigenous community in Jarara | Amnesty International 
 On 22 May, Judge Teothonio Costa revoked his decision of 25 April 1996 which would have resulted in the evicition of some 250 Guarani-kaiowa Indians from the village of Jarara in Juti, Mato Grosso do Sul. The Indians may now remain on the land while the case is sub-judice. If the final decision on the merit of the case goes against the Kaiowa, they may be later evicted from the land.
