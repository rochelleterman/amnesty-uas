 On 14 February 2000, Dorthia Bynum was sentenced to at    least 124 years in prison as part of a plea agreement to  escape a possible death sentence. In 1999, the            prosecution had announced its intention to seek the death penalty against her for a crime she was accused of        committing when she was 17 years and three months old.    International law forbids the use of the death penalty    for crimes committed by under-18-year-olds.
