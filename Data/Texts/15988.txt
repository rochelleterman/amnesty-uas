 On 6 March 1995, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Georgia sentenced Irakli Dokvadze and Petre Gelbakhiani to death without right of appeal. Fifteen other defendants received sentences ranging from 14 years to two-and-a-half years. The charges against Omari Kochlamazashvili and Zurab Bardzhimashvili have been removed from this case but they reportedly remain in detention and the charges against them still stand. AI is calling for the death sentences to be commuted; AI remains concerned about allegations that proceedings in this trial have fallen short of international standards, that defendants were tortured and that they have suffered ill-health as a result of conditions of detention."
