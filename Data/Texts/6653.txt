 On the evening of 27 October 1993 several armed men in civilian clothes reportedly invaded the GAM offices and confiscated all their records and equipment. A female member of GAM in the office at the time, was tied up by the assailants. Other GAM members are continuing to occupy Congress and there are serious concerns for their safety. GAM began their occupation of Congress on 26 October 1993 following testimonies made by imprisoned ex- soldiers Francisco Solbal and Tiburcio Hernandez. There is also concern for the safety of CONAVIGUA and CUC and other indigenous peasants who began an occupation on 27 October of the offices of the Organization of American States (OAS) in Guatemala City.
