 Jean Rubaduka has narrowly escaped two assassination attempts in recent days and four priests including Abbe Andre Sibomana have been threatened by a senior military official. Andre Sibomana has frequently denounced human rights violations by the present government and its predecessor.  To date the four are unharmed but AI fears for their safety in an atmosphere of rising intimidation against human rights activists in Rwanda."
