 Mexico: Fear for safety: Marco Vinicio Gallardo Enriquez | Amnesty International 
 The above, son of Brigadier General Jose Francisco Gallardo Rodriguez, was assaulted and robbed on 8 June by two unidentified armed men, inside the military housing estate where he lives. Local human rights organizations believe that the motive of this attack was not robbery, as most of his belongings were recovered intact. They believe that it may be related to recent military court proceedings against his father, who is in detention and has been accused of ""dishonouring the army"" for a dissertation in which he called for the establishment of a military human rights ombudsman's office in Mexico.
