 Ecuador: ""Disappearance"" / fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 There is concern for the safety of Jeremias Ramirez, a Colombian national, and two unidentified friends, who have ""disappeared"" after being detained on 10 June 1997 by men who identified themselves as members of the National Police. A habeas corpus petition filed for Jeremias Ramirez has resulted in the municipal authorities of the Metropolitan District of Quito ordering his immediate release. However the habeas corpus remains ineffective while the police deny having detained them.
