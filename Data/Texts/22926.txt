 Morocco: Seven detainees allege torture in Morocco | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Seven men arrested on 28 June in the Moroccan city of Fes are in urgent need of medical treatment. All seven are reported to have been tortured, and at least five of them are alleged to have been raped. They have received no treatment for their injuries. Two of them have chronic health problems for which they need medication and treatment, but this too has been denied them. All seven may face charges on the basis of statements they say they were forced to sign under torture. "
