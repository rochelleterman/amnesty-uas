 The five leading members of the Nuba community in Khartoum named above, are reported to have been detained in late June 1993. The reasons for their arrest are unknown, but the authorities are thought to suspect them of being opponents of the government. At least two of those arrested, Mustafa Angelo and Mohamed Hamad Kowa, were members of the banned Sudan National Party (SNP). They are believed to be held in incommunicado detention at an unknown location and there is grave concern that they may be subjected to torture. "
