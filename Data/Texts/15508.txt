 AI has received further reports that people seeking to flee the continuing conflict in the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic-Ichkeriya have been shot dead by Russian troops. Seven people, including a three-month-old baby girl, a 16-year-old girl and four women, were reportedly killed on 7 March 1995 by troops who fired on a convoy of vehicles seeking to leave the conflict zone. The vehicles reportedly contained mostly women and children trying to escape from the village of Achkhoy-Martan."
