 DRC/Rwanda: ""Disappearance"" / fear for safety: Francine   Ngoy (f) | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is extremely concerned for the      safety of Francine Ngoy who ""disappeared"" in November     1999. She was arrested in the DRC on 27 May 1999 and      accused of having contact with enemy forces -             particularly the Congolese Government and the Rwandese    interahamwe militia. She ""disappeared"" in November after  being reportedly transferred from Goma to Gisenyi, in     neighbouring Rwanda.
