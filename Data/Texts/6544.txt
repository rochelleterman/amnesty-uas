 Guatemala: Fear for Safety: Staff and volunteers of the Asociaci√≥n de Mujeres Ixqik, Ixqik Women's Association. | Amnesty International 
 The Ixqik Women's Association is supporting a rape victim in a high-profile court case. The organization's offices have been raided three times in nine days in what appears to be a deliberate attempt to intimidate the staff and volunteers. Police have failed to protect them. The burglars took personal details of all the staff of the Association, and Amnesty International believes they are in serious danger.
