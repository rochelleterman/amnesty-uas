 Nine human rights defenders and pro-democracy activists named in this action have received a number of anonymous threats, including death threats, in the last two weeks. As a result, they have had to take precautions for their safety such as moving from their house, or not making public statements, after receiving anonymous SMS messages, telephone calls and emails threatening them."
