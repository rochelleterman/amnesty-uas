 Iran: Fear of death penalty / prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 Four employees of the Iranian daily newspaper Tous,  Mashallah Shamsolva'ezin, Hamid Reza Jalaipour, Mohammad Javadi Hessar and Rahim Nabavi,  may be tried with general charges of subversion, which could lead to heavy penalties. There is a further concern that they could be charged with the offence of moharebeh ba khoda (?enmity with God') which, if they are convicted, carries a mandatory death sentence.
