 UA 288/92 - Israel and the Occupied Territories: torture / ill-treatment: Ahmad Sulayman Musa Qatamesh | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is concerned about allegations that Ahmad Qatamesh, a Palestinian aged 39, has been ill-treated during interrogation. He was arrested on 1 September 1992 and apparently taken first to Ramallah Prison, then to Petah Tikva. He may currently be held in the Moscobiyyah detention centre in Jerusalem. He appeared before a judge on 10 September after his lawyer applied for a bail hearing. According to the minutes of the session, Ahmad Qatamesh complained that he had been held in solitary confinement in a filthy cell, deprived of sleep and hooded on two occasions; he claims that he almost suffocated twice because of the hood. One interrogator reportedly told him that he should have been killed rather than detained. He also complained of headaches and breathing difficulties. "
