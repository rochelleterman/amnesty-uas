 Over 15 people, including those named above, were arrested on 17 and 18 July 1994 following a seminar organized by the Yemen Times. All were arrested by al-Amn al-Siyassi (political security) and are being held incommunicado in solitary confinement in a detention centre in al-Safia, Sana'a. They are prisoners of conscience. At least four of those initially were detained were released 24 hours later, including Dr 'Abdul-'Aziz al-Saqaf, editor-in-chief and publisher of the Yemen Times and Ahmad al-Sufi, a journalist. Both were subjected to beatings and Ahmad al-Sufi was chained with leg irons."
