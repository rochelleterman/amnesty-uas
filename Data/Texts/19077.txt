 Two prisoners have recently died in custody, apparently as a result of medical negligence. Five men, Mourad Boughanmi, Mondher Bejaoui (m), Jalel Mabrouk, Mohamed Hedi Khedimi, and Tewfiq Ben Faraj Fatnassi, are among scores of other political prisoners and prisoners of conscience who are being denied appropriate medical care, even though their health is failing. They are held in appalling conditions, and without proper medical treatment they may die.
