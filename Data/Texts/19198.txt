 Tunisia: Further information on fear of unfair trial / prisoner of conscience and new concerns: incommunicado detention/ fear of ill-treatment: Mohamed Kilani | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Mohamed Kilani, a leading member of the unauthorized PCOT, Tunisian Workers' Communist Party, arrested last January and currently serving a seven-year prison sentence, is being held incommunicado without access to his family or lawyers. He was due to appear in court on two occasions in October but the authorities failed to bring him to court. On 13 October his wife was told by the prison authorities that he was being ""punished"". AI is concerned that Mohamed Kilani may be at risk of ill-treatment while he is being held incommunicado."
