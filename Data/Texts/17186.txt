 Iran: Further information on prisoners of conscience/ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 All but three of the 33 women arrested during a protest in the capital, Tehran, on 4 March have been released. The remaining detainees, Mahboubeh Abbasgholizadeh, Zhila Bani Ya'qoub and Shadi Sadr, have apparently been accused of organizing the protest. Amnesty International considers the three women to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and association.
