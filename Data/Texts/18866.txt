 The eight Tunisian nationals named above, now including Jebari Boujemaa, face imminent refoulement and may already have been handed over to the authorities in Tunisia, where they face torture, ill-treatment and imprisonment after unfair trial. Jebari Boujemaa was arrested on 25 February near the border and is said to be presently held with the others. All eight are recognized aas refugees in need of protection by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Algiers. They are all either members or sympathizers of Al-Nahda, Renaissance. Despite repeated requests, UNHCR have still not been able to gain access to them, and so have not been able to confirm their whereabouts."
