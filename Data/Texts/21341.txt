 Sweden: Deportation / Torture: Jamil Mohammad Burhan (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The Swedish authorities are preparing to deport asylum-seeker Jamil Burhan to Eritrea, where he would be at real risk of being detained and tortured simply for having applied for asylum, which the authorities regard as betraying the country. Sweden is a state party to a number of international treaties that expressly prohibit deportation in these circumstances."
