 Iran: Death penalty/imminent execution: Ne'mat (m) | Amnesty International 
 A 17-year-old boy, known only as Ne'mat, is facing imminent execution. The Supreme Court has rejected his appeal, so he could be executed at any time. The Head of the Judiciary has the power to order a stay of execution and a review of the case. Iran is a state party to international treaties that expressly prohibit the death penalty for crimes committed by those under the age of 18.
