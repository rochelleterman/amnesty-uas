 Porferio Masuela, a 75-year-old farmer, was killed on 22 April 1993 in barangay (administrative unit) Luz, Guihulngan, Negros Oriental, by three members of a Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAGFUL). Inostacia Masuela, his 71-year-old wife, witnessed the murder, and was herself attacked when she tried to intervene. The three CAGFUs who were identified as members of a unit based in barangay Linantuyan, Guihulngan, Negros Oriental, remain at large and are fully armed. There is concern for the safety of Inostacia Masuela, who intends to file criminal charges against them. "
