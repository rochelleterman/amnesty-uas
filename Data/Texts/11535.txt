 At least three more people are reported to have been arrested in the wake of the capture of Xanana Gusmao, the leader of the East Timorese resistance who is himself detained incommunicado. Olandina Caceiro Alves, a friend of Gusmao's sister, her friend Oscar Lima and another person named Americo were reportedly arrested on 25 November 1992. Their whereabouts are not known and there are fears that they could be at risk of torture or ill- treatment. Reports of the arrests of Xanana Gusmao's father, brother, sister and brother-in-law have yet to be confirmed. "
