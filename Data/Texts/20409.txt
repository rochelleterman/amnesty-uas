 NA 
 Two environmental activists have been abducted in Mexico. There is serious concern for their safety. This follows the recent abduction of a local community leader and activist whose body was later found showing signs of torture. All three were supporters of the Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity (MPJD).  Supporters of the MPJD are increasingly being targeted and attacked for their activities."
