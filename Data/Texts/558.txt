 Over 220 people were arrested in the aftermath of a demonstration in N'Djamena on 8 August 1993. Most of those arrested are members of the Ouddaian community, who were protesting against recent killings in their homeland. On 10 August three community representatives, Outhman Issa, Prefect of Chari-Baguirmi prefecture, Imam Ahmat Abakar, and Mahamt Zalba were arrested. Many are reportedly held in the military court building at the gendarmerie headquarters, undergoing interrogation by the Police judiciare, Criminal investigation police, although a substantial number are held incommunicado, including the three community representatives. There is grave concern for their safety in the light of recent reports of torture, including that of Mahamat Saleh Issakha. "
