 Colombia: Fear for safety/death threats | Amnesty International 
 A paramilitary group which is backed by the security forces has reportedly threatened to kill trade union leader Samuel Morales, his sisters Matilde, Omayra and Gladys Morales and other members of his family. Samuel Morales has been in custody since August 2004, on charges of guerrilla activity which appear to be spurious. People charged in this way are often killed after they are released. Amnesty International believes the whole family are in grave danger.
