 Iran: Fear for safety/torture and ill treatment/possible prisoner of conscience/medical concern, Nasser Kheyrollahi(m)
 | Amnesty International 
 Nasser Kheyrollahi, aged 48, who attempted to expose official corruption, has been charged with vaguely worded offences which could see him detained as a prisoner of conscience. He is now held in Reja-i Shahr prison in Karaj, near      Tehran, together with prisoners convicted of violent      offences, where he has reportedly been tortured and       ill-treated repeatedly and has recently had several bones broken. He reportedly began a hunger strike on 17 January to draw attention to his situation.
