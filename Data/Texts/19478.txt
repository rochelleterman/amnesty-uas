 On 19 April, Ethiopian forces stormed Al Hidya mosque in north eastern Mogadishu, seizing over 40 children and youths who were undertaking religious classes at the mosque. The youths are reportedly currently detained at an Ethiopian military camp near the pasta factory in north Mogadishu. Ethiopian soldiers have reportedly said the youths would be released “once they had been investigated”, and “if they were not terrorists”. "
