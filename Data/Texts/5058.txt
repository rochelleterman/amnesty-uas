 AI is concerned for the safety of Elibardo Galvis Barrera following the apparent extrajudicial execution of his brothers and fellow members of the Community Action Movement of Aguachica, Jesus Emilio and Luis Tiberio Galvis Barrera. The two brothers were stopped by armed men on 24 September 1995 and later found tortured and beheaded. The same group reportedly killed a local police inspector on 24 September after ransacking a communal shop."
