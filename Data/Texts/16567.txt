 New information about Shaikh 'Abd al-Amir Mansur al-Jamri, who has been held without charge or trial since 15 April 1995, has renewed concern about his welfare. He was reportedly admitted to the military hospital in Bahrain on 7 June 1995, where he stayed for one week. It is believed that he has a chest infection. He is known to suffer from heart disease. Reports suggest that he may have been moved again to a location in the south of the country. It is feared that he may again be in incommunicado detention."
