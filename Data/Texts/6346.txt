 Guatemala: Extrajudicial execution/fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Gunmen have attacked three rural communities, Repollal Suquinay de Purulh‡, Los Cimientos and Santa Mar’a Tzeja, killing one community leader, Domingo Us Quix‡n, and attempting to kill another, Carlos Morales. In all three cases, the assailants were described as former members of the so-called civil patrols, which were supposedly disbanded, however, local peasant groups and human rights organisations report that they are now becoming active again.
