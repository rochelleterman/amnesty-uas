 NA 
 On 5 June 1994 a group of men, reported to be members of the security police of FUNCINPEC, fired rockets and rifles into the house of Pheng Kim, Second Vice-Governor of Stung Treng province. Heng Sor, her brother-in-law, and another person were wounded by shrapnel. The policemen are closely associated with two FUNCINEP officials in the province who have reportedly threatened the life of Pheng Kim since her appointment in December 1993."
