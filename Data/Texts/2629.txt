 The above-named are among 14 southern Sudanese civil servants and others reportedly arrested on 5 and 6 December 1994 in Juba. They are reported to be in detention at an unknown location. AI believes that they are at risk of torture in secret detention. The organization believes that they may be prisoners of conscience, detained for their peaceful oppositon to government policies. Five of the six named above are civil servants in the Equatoria State Ministries of Engineering (Town Planning), Agriculture and Housing. Their detention is rumoured to be related to their reluctance to implement the distribution of land around Juba to northern Sudanese relief organizations, which, allegedly, make conversion to Islam a condition for receiving relief. Tobias Atede reportedly works for a Christian-oriented NGO."
