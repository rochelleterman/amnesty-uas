 Amnesty International is concerned about the treatment and legal status of Dr Alemayehu Teferra, former President of Addis Ababa University and a former professor and dean of civil engineering, who was arrested on about 9 April 1993. He is being held incommunicado and without charge in Maikelawi security prison, a notorious detention and torture centre under the previous government of President Mengistu Haile-Mariam. Conditions in the prison are allegedly harsh. He is reportedly accused of being involved in the ""Red-Terror"" campaign by the former government. The 18 students were arrested on 22 April 1993 for demonstrating against the dismissal of 41 university professors and lecturers and 11 other students. "
