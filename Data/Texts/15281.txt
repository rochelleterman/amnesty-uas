 A major police operation in and around Batman which began on 16 October 1992 continues, with new detentions constantly being made. Some 30 to 40 people are believed still to be detained, such as the Solak brothers, who have been held beyond the legal limit of 30 days. Sukru Yilmaz has been released; he was allegedly tortured during the first days of detention; Tahsin and Haci Adlik and M Sirin Dogan have also been released. Some of those detained have now been formally arrested. Almost all of them are said to have reported torture; none was issued with a medical certificate when examined by a doctor at the end of detention. The state prosecutor is investigating the death in detention of Ramazan Altunsoz. "
