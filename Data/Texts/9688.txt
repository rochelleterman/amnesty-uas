 John Sterling Gardner, white, aged 34, is scheduled to be executed on 23 October 1992. He had been sentenced to death in 1983 for the murder of two people during a robbery in December 1982. His counsel at trial had reportedly been reprimanded by the state four months before the trial and was later suspended from practice of law in North Carolina for professional negligence. He was abusing drugs and alcohol at the time of Gardner's trial. An expert criminal defense attorney has reportedly testified that Gardner's trial attorney had failed to satisfy even minimal standards of competence. Potentially mitigating evidence about abuse suffered during childhood was not presented at the trial. "
