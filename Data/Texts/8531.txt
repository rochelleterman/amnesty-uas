 United States of America: fear of refoulement: Haitian asylum-seekers held at the US Naval Base, Guantanamo, Cuba | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 AI is seriously concerned by the recent decision of the US Government forcibly to repatriate all Haitian asylum-seekers remaining at the US naval base in Guantanamo, without following internationally-accepted procedures to ensure that they are able to present asylum claims should they wish to do so. About a quarter of those remaining at the naval base have been forcibly returned. While conditions in Haiti have improved since the return of President Aristide, serious security concerns remain, particularly in some rural areas where officals associated with the former military government of Raoul Cedras reportedly remain in positions of power."
