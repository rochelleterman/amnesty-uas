 Zimbabwe: Fear for Safety/Intimidation | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is seriously concerned for the safety of the leaders, including Magodonga Mahlangu and Jenni Williams, and members of the grassroots women's activist group Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA). This follows the arrest of approximately 260 women, some carrying babies, at a peaceful post-election 'prayer vigil' in the capital Harare on 31 March. Although all of the women were released the following day, it is the fourth time WOZA activists have been arrested in 2005 and there are fears that further arrests may follow in the coming days and weeks.
