 Muhammed Mustafa, Khaled Ahmed 'Ali, Sherif Ramadhan, 'Amr Mourad, Salar Saleh, Hosam Muhammed Amin, Hussayn Ramadhan and Mas'oud Hamid were sentenced to prison terms by the Supreme State Security Court (SSSC) on 27 June. Four were released immediately, as their sentences were equal to the time they had already spent in prison. Three others remain in prison in inhumane conditions, at risk or torture, as does the eighth member of the group.
