 UA 415/92 - Malawi: fear of torture / legal concern: 50 people arrested, including Harry Chiume | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Some 200 peaceful demonstrators are reported to have been arrested in Blantyre on 20 December 1992, apparently for planning to march in protest at the imprisonment of Chakufwa Chihana. Other demonstrators were dispersed in Lilongwe and Mzuzu, but no arrests are known to have been made. Of those arrested in Blantyre, 50 are reportedly still in police custody, held incommunicado. Those still detained include Harry Chiume, Chakufwa Chihana's lawyer and interim publicity secretary for AFORD, and his wife. AI is calling for the release of those still detained and is concerned that the detainees may be at risk from torture. "
