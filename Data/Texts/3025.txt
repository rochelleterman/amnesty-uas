 The trial of those named above concluded on 24 November 1994. All were found guilty of having participated in a demonstration without proper police permission but were acquitted of the second charge, sedition. They received a sentence of seven days' detention, backdated to include their period in pre-trial detention. The seven walked free at the end of the trial. They have lodged an appeal against their conviction. Two of the above-named, Mphandlana Shongwe and Msongelwa Lukhele, were already under sentences suspended for three years after a similar trial last year. They were rearrested after the Director of Public Prosecutions applied for their sentences to be revived. They were released on bail by a magistrates' court pending a further hearing on 14 December."
