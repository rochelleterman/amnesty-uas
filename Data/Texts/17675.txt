 Israel and the Occupied Territories: Deliberate and arbitrary killings / fear of further killings: five civilians and one suicide bomber killed in bus bombing | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Five civilians and a suicide bomber were killed and about 33 people were wounded on the morning of 24 July 1995 when a bomb exploded on a bus in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan. The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has reportedly claimed responsibility. AI fears that it may carry out further such attacks. AI strongly condemns such deliberate and arbitrary killings and calls on Hamas to halt attacks against civilians immediately."
