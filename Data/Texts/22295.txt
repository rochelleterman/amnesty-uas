 Iran: Fear of torture or ill treatment/ incommunicado detention: Dr Mehdi Zakerian (m) | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 Dr Mehdi Zakerian, an academic, was detained on or around 15 August 2008, though the exact circumstances of his arrest are not clear. His family has been permitted to meet him once since then, in a Tehran courtroom, but they do not know where he is held. He has not been charged with any offence, and may be at risk of torture or other ill-treatment. Amnesty International believes that his detention may be a politically motivated attempt to stop him travelling to the USA to start a new job at a university.  "
