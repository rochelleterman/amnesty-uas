 Mexico: Fear for safety | Amnesty International 
 Gregorio Camacho Salaz, community activist: On 19 October 1997, Gregorio Camacho Salaz, President of the Communal Peasant Farmers Coalition of Zapotitlan and member of the Independent Organisation of the Tlahauc Zone, was violently abducted in Tlahuac, Mexico City. He was released in the early hours of 21 October 1997, after being beaten, subjected to mock executions, and threatened with death because of his activism on behalf of the poor. Amnesty International remains deeply concerned for his safety, fearing that the death threats may be carried out, should he continue his activism.
