 UA 280/94 - Singapore: death penalty: Abdullah A Rahman, Lim Choon Chye | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 11 July 1994 the Court of Appeal rejected attempts by the lawyers of Abdullah A Rahman and Lim Choon Chye to reopen their appeals on the grounds of new evidence. There are now fears that both men are at risk of imminent execution. Abdullah A Rahman, a Malaysian national, was sentenced to death on 29 January 1993 for drug trafficking. Lim Choon Chye was also sentenced to death in 1993. Their only hope for clemency now lies with President Ong Teng Cheong."
