 The trial of 44 defendants, mostly ethnic Albanian former police officers, continues in Prizren. Several of the defendants are in poor health. Sezair Shaipi reportedly suffers from diabetes, heart and kidney ailments and rheumatic pains. Ramadan Ndrecaj who reportedly suffered brain contusion as a result of police beatings following his arrest, was hardly able to stand in court. Halil Blakaj lost consciousness in court on 28 June and was taken to hospital. Another man Xhemajli Shasivari suffered a heart attack in prison on 18 August and is also in hospital. Shaip Mustafa was admitted to hospital with severe pains and stomach bleeding. Two others, Syle Millaku and Faik Jasiqi, are also said to be in very poor health. Defence lawyers have claimed that their poor health has been caused by or severely aggravated by torture or other ill-treatment following arrest and prolonged imprisonment. On 17 July the trial of 72 ethnic Albanian former police officers ended in Pristina. The court found 69 of them guilty. Most were released pending appeal."
