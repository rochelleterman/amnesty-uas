 Basile Mahan Gahé, a trade unionist from Côte d’Ivoire who was charged with state security offences and imprisoned, is being held in harsh conditions, according to the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC). Amnesty International believes Basile Mahan Gahé is a possible prisoner of conscience, solely detained for his political views and because of his alleged links to former President Laurent Gbagbo’s government."
