 Tunisian national Safouan Ammouri is at imminent risk of being forcibly returned to Tunisia where it is feared that he would face arbitrary arrest, torture and other ill-treatment. He is currently being held in a detention facility in the Syrian capital, Damascus, where individuals are held prior to deportation. Two other Tunisians who were arrested with him in July 2007 were returned to Tunisia on 15 January 2008 and their families have received no news of them since. "
