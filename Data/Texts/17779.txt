 Israel/Occupied Territories: House Demolition

 | Amnesty International 
 The Israeli authorities are preparing to demolish the house of an elderly couple in East Jerusalem, on the grounds that it was built without a permit. Mohammad and Zarifa Abbasi, aged 78 and 76, are in poor health, and there are serious concerns that if they were made homeless this could have dire consequences.
