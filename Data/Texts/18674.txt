 Kurdish activist Ma'rouf Mulla Ahmed, aged 53, leading    member of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Unity Party       (Yeketi Party), was reportedly arrested on 12 August at a Syrian checkpoint   on the country's border with Lebanon. He is now believed to be detained incommunicado at Branch 285 of State Security, in the capital, Damascus, and is   at grave risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Amnesty International believes that he may be a prisoner of       conscience, detained solely for his peaceful political    activities.
