 All the detainees listed above have been released from detention, and charges against them dropped. There is, however, concern that during their detention they were tortured and ill-treated by army and police officers. On 8 September Amnesty International representatives visited approximately 30 detainees at Boksburg prison, including those named above, and heard first-hand accounts of their ill-treatment. There is also concern at the conduct of the district surgeon who saw the detainees on 12 August. He showed little interest in their injuries and failed to make any arrangements for necessary medical care or treatment. "
