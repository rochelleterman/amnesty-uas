 Two long-term political prisoners are among seven people who face imminent execution, according to Minister of Justice Haiji Utoyo Usman. Informed sources say that the two are Bungkus and Nataneal Marsudi who are among a group of five prisoners sentenced to death for their alleged involvement in the abortive 1965 coup. They were all convicted after unfair trials and have been in detention for up to 30 years. Three prisoners on death row in Surabaya are believed to be Djais Adi Prayitno, Nyonya Sumiarsih and Sugeng who were sentenced to death in 1988. Sugeng is being held in isolation in prison on the island of Nusa Kambangan, East Java. The other four prisoners are being held in Cipinang prison, Jakarta."
