 Colombia: Civilian population  living in the neighbourhood of la Esperanza, and neighbouring areas of Barrancabermeja city, central Colombia | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is very concerned for the safety of people living in the neighbourhood of La Esperanza, in    Barrancabermeja city, and surronding areas, after a 10    year old boy was shot in the leg, on the night of 5       February 2000, when an army patrol reportedly went into   the neighbourhood and started to fire their guns          indiscriminately and otherwise terrorize people.
