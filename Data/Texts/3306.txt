 DRC: Fear of imminent execution | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned that 61 people on      death row in Kinshasa, including Kasilibani Kabamba,      Jean-Louis Bosenyi, Ilunga Mbaya, Djuma Banga and Kuna    Diavanga, may soon be executed. Their only hope is a      presidential pardon.
