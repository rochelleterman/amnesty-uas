 Melike Alp, housewife and mother of three, was taken from her home on 30 December 1994 and committed to Diyarbakir Central Cloased Prison. She is a board member of the Diyarbakir branch of the Turkish Human Rights Association and as such is held responsible, like the others named above, for their recent report on human rights violations which was banned on 13 December 1994. AI considers her and the others to be prisoners of conscience. No trial has yet been opened against them."
