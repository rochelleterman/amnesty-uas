 NA 
 A community of some 250 people in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, have been left without shelter after police forcibly evicted them and set fire to their homes, without any prior notice. The community are now living out in the open, in many cases having also lost their possessions. The government has not offered the community food, water or shelter."
