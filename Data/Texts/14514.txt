 Turkey: Death threats / fear for safety: Halil Cabir Karacadagli | Amnesty International 
 There is concern at reports that Halil Cabir Karacadgli, President of the Diyarbakir Branch No 2 of Tes-Is (Turkish Union of Energy, Water and Gas Workers), has been the victim of police harassment and death threats following his detention and torture. He has repeatedly refused to act as a police informer. He was previously detained and tortured in November 1996 by police and forced to sign a statement that he was involved with the illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK). After his release he received death threats and on 3 April 1997 he received further threats.
