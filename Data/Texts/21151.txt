 Army Major Niranjan Basnet has not been arrested on his return to Nepal. Despite instructions from the Prime Minister that he be arrested, military police escorted him to the army's headquarters in the capital, Kathmandu. The army is believed to be waiting for a decision from its Chief of Staff on whether to surrender Major Basnet to a civilian court. This decision is expected around 19 December."
