 USA (Indiana): Further Information on Death penalty / Legal concern, Darnell Williams | Amnesty International 
 Recent DNA testing supports Darnell Williams's claim that he was not present at the murders for which he was sentenced to death. The late Governor, Frank O'Bannon, had stopped Williams's execution shortly before it was due to be carried out on 1 August, in order to allow modern DNA testing on blood evidence. However, a spokeswoman for the Attorney General has said that the State of Indiana will continue to pursue Williams's execution.
