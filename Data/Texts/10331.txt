 Munir Hussain, aged about 34, faces imminent execution, after a full bench of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court upheld his sentence on 20 June 1993. He was sentenced to death by the District and Sessions Court in Dhaka on 21 May 1990. If his appeal for clemency to the President is turned down, he could be executed shortly afterwards. "
