 Ecuador: Fear for safety/Threats

 | Amnesty International 
 Indigenous leader, MarÁa Iza Quinatoa, has reportedly been the target of an increasing campaign of threats and intimidation. Amnesty International believes that this may be linked to her campaigning work against the signing of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Ecuador and the USA. The organization is concerned for her safety, and that of her family and other members of the staff at Uni¢n de Organizaciones Campesinas de Cotopaxi (UNOCANC), Cotopaxi Peasants Organizations' Union, of which she is President of the women's section.
