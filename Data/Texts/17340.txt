 Iran: Prisoner of conscience/ Torture and ill-treatment/ Medical concer: Mohammad Hassan Fallahiya (m)

 | Amnesty International 
 Journalist Mohammad Hassan Fallahiya, a member of Iran's Arab minority, is serving a three-year sentence in Tehran's Evin Prison after writing articles criticizing the Iranian government and reportedly contacting opposition groups based outside Iran. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and association, and is concerned that he may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. He is reportedly being denied the medical treatment he needs.
