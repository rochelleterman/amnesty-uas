 Eritrea: Torture / Prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 One hundred and sixty members of banned Christian churches are at grave risk of torture, following their arrest on 15 and 16 October. It is not known where they are being held. Two Christian men who were among the detainees reportedly died after being tortured in an effort to force them to renounce their faith. Amnesty International considers the detainees to be prisoners of conscience, held solely for the peaceful expression of their beliefs.
