 Peru: Possible cruel and inhumane treatment: Prisoners awaiting transfer to the new Challapalca Prison | Amnesty International 
 There is serious concern that prisoners currently awaiting transfer to the new maximum security Challapalca Prison, will be the victims of cruel and inhumane treatment as a result of the prison's altitude, 5,000 metres above sea level. Prolonged exposure to this altitude would put inmates at risk of suffering serious health problems and even death.
