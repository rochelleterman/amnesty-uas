 NA 
 At about 11pm on 23 September 1995, some 10 armed soldiers of the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Organization entered Sho Clo Camp, home to thousands of Karen displaced people. Win Kyi and Win Myint, two brothers and Karen community leaders, were abducted and probably taken to Paw Pa Hta, Myanmar. There has been no news of the brothers since their abduction. It is not clear why they were taken, although in the past DKBO have seized Karen community leaders, apparently in an attempt to make them join the DKBO in some leadership capacity."
