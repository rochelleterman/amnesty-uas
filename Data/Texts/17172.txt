 Iran: Further information on Fear for safety/Incommunicado detention/Risk of torture and ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 Tehran's Chief Prosecutor Said Mortazavi has reportedly told the parents of Reza Ameri Nassab that ""they should bear in mind the grave stone for their son."" This increases concerns for the safety of the three other detained student activists, Arash Hashemi, Said Razavi Faghih and Mehdi Habibi. Amnesty International considers the four men to be human rights defenders and prisoners of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful expression of their political beliefs.
