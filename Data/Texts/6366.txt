 UA 213/94 - Guatemala: fear for safety: Fernando Quezada Toruno, Rodolfo Quezada Toruno | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 On 31 May 1994 two bombs exploded in Guatemala City and sources indicate that they may be an attempt by hardline elements in the government to sabotage the Guatemalan peace talks currently taking place in Mexico City. One was planted opposite Fernando Quezada Toruno's residence, the other at a private clothing company named Sandra Zaid Zaid. No one was injured in either explosion. Fernando Quezada Toruno, Vice-President of the weekly magazine La Cronica, is the brother of Bishop Rodolfo Quezada Toruno, the former mediator of the peace talks. He is now the president of the Civilian Sectors Assembly (ASC) which has recently made recommendations on the resettlement of people displaced by the armed conflict."
