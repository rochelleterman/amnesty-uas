 According to his lawyer Kim Sam-sok attempted suicide on 20 September, by hitting his head against a wall until he lost consciousness, apparently traumatized by his interrogation and ill-treatment. He said that he had been forced to admit to things he had not done. After he regained consciousness, he was again interrogated and threatened by a group of some 15 officials. His wife, who was allowed to visit him on 21 September, reported that he was in poor health. There is also concern at reports that his sister Kim Un-ju may have been forced under interrogation to make a confession. They have been held by the Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) since 8 September. "
