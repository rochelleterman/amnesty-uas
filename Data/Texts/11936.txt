 Three villagers were reportedly killed and three others wounded by soldiers of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces in Ban Teay village on 11 April 1994. Those killed include a boy aged 7. Soldiers allegedly entered the village and demanded a chicken. When the villagers did not produce one, they reportedly accused them of being ""Pol Pot"" (linked to the Khmer Rouge) and fired. After the attack reinforcements were sent to deal with the reported Khmer Rouge presence in the village but withdrew because there were no Khmer Rouge in the area. AI is concerned for the safety of the villagers ia is calling for a full investigationof the incident."
