 NA 
 According to Cuban news agency reports dated 4 November 1993, Felix Oviedo Aguilera has been sentenced to death by a Havana court, after being convicted of murder and armed robbery for an attack on a Havana bus on 2 August 1993. This is the fourth death sentence to be passed in recent weeks, and comes in the wake of statements from the authorities vowing to crack down on crime and internal unrest, after a spate of incidents of vandalism, apparently a result of frustration over economic harships.
