 Approximately 90 Bhutanese people detained at Berhampur Central Jail, West Bengal, were beaten with canes by jail guards. At least 50 people were reported injured, 12 of them seriously. Two detainees had to be hospitialized. The incident apparently happened when the detainees tried to lodge a complaint with the Jail Superintendent about the beating of two detainees the previous day.
