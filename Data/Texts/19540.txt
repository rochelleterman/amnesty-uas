 Mauritania: Further information: Anti-slavery activists continue to be detained | Amnesty International 
 NA 
 The seven members of the anti-slavery organisation IRA Mauritania, who remained in detention after four of their colleagues were released, had their court hearing on 27 June. The judge stated that the court case could not go ahead and sent the case back to the prosecutor. In usual practice, detainees are released following such an order until new charges can be brought. However, the seven remain in detention on the same charges.  "
