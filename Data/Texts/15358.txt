 AI has learned that both the brothers above were ordered to be released on 22 September. However, only Sibli Yilmaz left detention. He had reportedly been severely tortured and did not return home for fear of further persecution. His brother is alleged to have cooperated with police after torture and to have refused to leave detention for fear of reprisals."
