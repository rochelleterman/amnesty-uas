 Mexico: Fear for safety / Death threats | Amnesty International 
 Journalist Misael Habana, whose co-presenter Amado Ramçrez Dillanes was shot dead on 6 April, received death threats the following day. The motive of the murder is being investigated by the Guerrero state authorities, and two men were arrested for questioning on 10 April in connection with the murder. Amnesty International is concerned that unless state and federal authorities investigate the case thoroughly and ensure the protection of Misael Habana, other journalists may be at similar risk.
