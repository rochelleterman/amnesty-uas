 Brazil: Fear of persecution: Concei√ß√£o Paganele (f), human rights defender
 | Amnesty International 
 Police have begun investigations into a number of apparently politically motivated allegations against Conceià®o Paganele, who runs a mothers' organisation that monitors conditions inside Brazil's juvenile detention centres, and visits detainees. As one of the key critics of S®o Paulo's juvenile detention system, Conceià®o Paganele's work has been vital in exposing the grave human rights abuses that have long dogged the centres.
