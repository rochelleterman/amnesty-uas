 Ukraine: Further information: Torture/ill-treatment | Amnesty International 
 The Interior Ministry have written to a Ukrainian human rights organisation, ""in answer to letters from human rights organisations which have been sent from almost the whole world,"" saying that a ""careful, professional investigation"" has found ""no objective confirmation of any torture or physical or psychological pressure"" used against Beslan Kutarba and Revaz Kishikashvili, who have been in police custody in Sevastopol since August. Kutarba's lawyer has written to Amnesty International in rather different terms.
