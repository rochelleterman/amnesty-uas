 Following the execution of Glen Ashby on 14 July there is grave concern that more prisoners will be executed regardless of the state of their appeals. Glen Ashby was notified on 12 July that his execution had been scheduled for 14 July. Despite an assurance from the Attorney General, Keith Sobion, that he would not be executed until his appeals for a stay of execution had been exhausted, the process was still in progress when the execution was carried out."
