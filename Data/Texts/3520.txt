 Panji Kaunda, eldest son of former President of Zambia Kenneth Kaunda, and Wilfred Wanani, Chairman for Local Government and Housing in the opposition UNIP party have been released. The others named above, detained under regulations which came into force after a State of Emergency was declared on 4 March 1993, have been informed of the reasons for their arrest: they are accused of authorship and dissemination of a document which outlines a strategy of civil disobedience to make Zambia ungovernable and of conspiring to implement such a strategy. There does not appear to be enough evidence to bring criminal charges. The Minister of Legal Affairs has indicated that allegations of ill-treatment will be investigated. "
