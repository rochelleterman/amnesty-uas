 China: Further information on Fear of Torture/Arbitrary Arrest | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International is concerned at the continuing harassment of workers' leaders. Wang Dawei, a labour protest leader in the city of Liaoyang in Liaoning Province, northeastern China was reportedly detained by police on 24 February, before being released four hours later. He had previously been detained following the workers' protest in March 2002. Amnesty International remains concerned for his safety as he is still at risk of detention by the police.
