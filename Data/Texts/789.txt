 Ethiopia: Further information on ill-treatment / prisoners of conscience | Amnesty International 
 200 university students and new name: Ishetu Alene, a blind law student: Many of the students detained at a peaceful demonstration in Addis Ababa on 21 March 1997 have been released without charge, after signing a statement demanded by the authorities. While in police custody the students were subjected to ill-treatment. Forty-one students remain in custody - the alleged ringleaders and others who refused to sign the statement. They include Ishetu Alene, a blind student who was badly beaten. They have not yet been taken to court. Amnesty International is continuing to call for their immediate and unconditional release as prisoners of conscience.
