 On 30 December2007, at least 50 and possibly hundreds of men from Iranâ€™s Ahwazi Arab minority were arrested as they attended a memorial at the Hamzeh mosque in Ahvaz City. They were reportedly detained following an attack by members of the police and Bassij forces. Some or all may be prisoners of conscience, detained solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression and association."
