 An estimated 2,000 families from two villages of the Jagatsinghpur district, in Orissa state, India, are under the threat of being forcibly evicted from common land used for farming and cultivation. On 18 May, Orissa state authorities forcibly evicted at least 200 farmers and destroyed betel vines and farming sheds on common land. The farmers and their families are dependent on this land for their livelihood and some families, also for their housing. "
