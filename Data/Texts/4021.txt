 In an ambush by gunmen on 3 December 1992, Valdinar Pereira Barros, President of the Rural Workers Trade Union of Imperatriz was wounded and another trade union director, Francisco Geronimo da Silva, was killed. While Valdinar Pereira Barros was being treated for his injuries in hospital, armed men were twice found in the hospital grounds; it is believed that they were attempting to kill him. Valdinar Perira is now in hiding. He has been receiving death threats during 1992 for his trade union activities in support of rural workers in land disputes with powerful land claimants. He has been particulary involved in supporting the setting up of ecological reserves for the sustainable harvesting of forest produce. "
