 Iraq: Further information on possible ""disappearance""/fear of forcible  return/fear of torture | Amnesty International 
 Amnesty International has been contacted by the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), and by people claiming to be family members of Hossein Pouyan. They have requested that no further action be taken on this case. The organization has a policy of agreeing to requests made by families of the victims of human rights abuses not to take action on their behalf. It is therefore asking that no more appeals are sent on behalf of Hossein Pouyan and Mohammad Ali Zahedi.
